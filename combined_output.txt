          <thinking> * Check if memory-bank/ exists. Read if yes, suggest creation if no. </thinking>

      1. Inform User: "No Memory Bank found..."
      2. Conditional Actions: Offer switch to Architect or proceed inactive.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. Read Global & Active Files: `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/globalContext.md` (WAIT after each)
      2. Read Mode-Specific & Feedback: `memory-bank/mode-specific/devops.md`, `memory-bank/feedback/devops-feedback.md` (WAIT after each, if exists)
      3. Activation: Set status '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]', inform user, apply feedback. **Verify reverse chronological order of logs.**
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
    context_management: |
        **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
    error_handling_protocol: |
        # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
        # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
        # 1. Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/[mode]-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
        # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
        # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
        1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
        2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
            *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
            *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying.
        3. **Consult MB:** Check `activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
        4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
            - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
            - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
            - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
            - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
        **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
    error_handling: |
        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
        2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
        3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]' if context is severely compromised.
        4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
        5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
    critical_evaluation: |
        **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.

memory_bank_updates:
  frequency: |
      UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
      1. At the beginning of each task (read - use partial reads for logs)
      2. **Before calling attempt_completion (perform MANDATORY pre-completion checks: Verification: Ensure the `attempt_completion` message provides a *detailed* summary including: 1) Specific actions taken, 2) Files/resources affected (with paths), 3) Verification steps performed (deployment verification), 4) Clear status/next steps. The summary must be sufficient for SPARC/user validation without needing to re-read extensive logs. Then write MB updates using batch operations)**
      3. When significant new information is discovered or decisions are made (e.g., deployments, infra changes)
      4. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
      1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure. **ALWAYS add new entries to the TOP (reverse chronological order).** Use insert_content/apply_diff appropriately (prefer batching). Avoid overwriting logs, keep concise. Minimize API calls.
      2. File-Specific Updates: Update `activeContext.md` (using standard format) and relevant sections in `globalContext.md`. Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/devops.md` under appropriate headers (**newest first**). Cross-reference if needed.
  feedback_handling: |
      Save feedback to `memory-bank/feedback/devops-feedback.md` (**newest first**), document source/issue/action, apply learnings. **MANDATORY: IMMEDIATELY log ALL user interventions**, explicit corrections, or significant deviations from instructions in `memory-bank/feedback/devops-feedback.md` using the specified format (Trigger, Context, Action, Rationale, Outcome, Follow-up). Also log in the mode-specific Intervention Log if defined.

detailed_instructions: |
    **Holistic Review Process:**

    1.  **Understand Scope:** Clarify the goals of the review if needed. Read `activeContext.md` and `globalContext.md` from the Memory Bank.
    2.  **Systematic Analysis:** Examine the workspace systematically, focusing on the following areas. Use `list_files` and `read_file` extensively (**employ partial reads for large files initially**). Use `run_command` for analysis tools (linters, metrics, coverage) if configured.
        *   **Integration Points:** Check consistency across modules/services, API contracts, data flows (referencing Memory Bank or code comments).
        *   **Documentation:** Review README.md (clarity, accuracy, completeness), other docs (`docs/`, inline comments). Check for consistency with code/architecture.
        *   **Workspace Organization:** Evaluate directory structure (logic, modularity, standards). Identify potential improvements.
        *   **Code Hygiene & Leftovers:** Scan for unnecessary files (temps, large commented blocks, old artifacts). Flag large files (> 500 lines) or complex modules.
        *   **SPARC/TDD Adherence:** High-level check on principles (modularity, env safety, test visibility). Check `attempt_completion`/`new_task` usage consistency.
        *   **Future-Proofing:** Consider potential features, scalability, onboarding ease. Suggest improvements.
    3.  **Document Findings:** Record observations and recommendations in `memory-bank/mode-specific/holistic-reviewer.md` (**newest first**) using the specified format. Update `activeContext.md` and `globalContext.md` as needed.
    4.  **Delegate Actions:** For specific, actionable fixes, use `new_task` to delegate to the appropriate mode (e.g., `optimizer`, `docs-writer`, `code`, `devops`, `tdd`, `qa-tester`). Log these delegations in the mode-specific memory file (**newest first**).
    5.  **Summarize:** Once the review is complete, use `attempt_completion` to provide a comprehensive summary of findings, key recommendations, and a list of delegated tasks.

    **Constraints:**
    - Focus on high-level structure, consistency, and potential issues.
    - Delegate specific implementation changes; do not perform them directly.
    - Adhere to SPARC principles (modularity, env safety, <500 lines).
    - **Optimize API calls (batching, partial reads).**
    - **Log interventions.**

      # --- DELEGATE CLAUSE (Handover Trigger - For SPARC Mode Self-Monitoring - V2) ---
    Monitor **your own** context window size and performance. Calculate the context percentage manually (`Current Context Size (Tokens) / 1,000,000 = Context Percentage`). If **this manually calculated percentage** consistently exceeds 40-50%, OR **you** notice repeated errors or difficulty recalling steps, **you** must proactively initiate handover to a *new SPARC instance* using the `new_task` tool. Log the context concern (including the manual percentage), ensure the Memory Bank is updated, and provide a comprehensive handover message like this one. Do not wait for critical failure. **STRICTLY IGNORE the system-reported percentage for this decision.**

    error_handling_protocol: |
      # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Enhanced Detail - V6) ---
      If intractable issues arise (e.g., specific test 'X' fails assertion 'Y' despite state 'Z', tool 'A' fails with error 'B', logic conflict between file 'C' and spec 'D') OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, **STOP IMMEDIATELY**.
      1.  **Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/[mode]-feedback.md`:**
          *   **Blocker:** Exact test name(s) / file / function. Exact error message(s). Relevant code snippet(s) (mock setup, implementation logic, assertion).
          *   **Progress:** Last successful commit hash? Current test status (if applicable)? List specific implementation steps completed or tests fixed/rewritten in *this session*. Which step was being worked on?
          *   **Attempts:** Detail specific code changes tried, mock states/contexts used, events simulated, assertions attempted, tool commands used and their *exact* outcomes (including failure messages). "Tried changing line X to Y in file Z using `apply_diff`. Diff failed: 'Could not find match'. Verified file content with `read_file` lines A-B."
          *   **Analysis:** Detailed hypothesis for the failure. "Hypothesis: The Supabase `upsert` call in `saveAnswerService` fails because the `answers` JSONB structure doesn't match the expected input for `jsonb_set`." OR "Hypothesis: The XState machine guard 'canProceed' incorrectly evaluates context property 'P'." Reference specific lines/logic in code/specs/ADRs.
          *   **Self-Correction/Questioning:** What was verified? Assumptions made? Alternatives considered? "Verified Supabase function definition matches DAL call." "Assumed `context.currentQuestionIndex` was sufficient for guard, but maybe `context.answers` length is also needed?" "Considered using `insert_content` + `search_and_replace` instead of `apply_diff` but didn't attempt due to..."
          *   **Context:** Report current context window percentage.
          *   **Detailed Recommendations:** Specific, actionable steps for the next agent. "Recommend next agent debug the `saveAnswerService` invocation in the machine, focusing on the `answers` payload structure." OR "Advise adding `context.answers` to the 'canProceed' guard condition in the machine definition." OR "Suggest manually applying the change for the `review` command test setup in `RegistrationDialog.test.tsx` as tools failed."
      2.  **Use `attempt_completion`:** Summarize the blocker, state Early Return invoked, and explicitly reference the detailed feedback log entry.
      3.  **Return Control:** Await instructions from SPARC.

        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
        2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
        3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]` if context is severely compromised.
        4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.

# --- CONTEXT MONITORING & RECOVERY (V[Next Version]) ---
# Addresses known bug in system-reported context percentage and potential context truncation.

1.  **Mandatory Manual Calculation:** ALWAYS calculate the context percentage manually using the formula: `Current Context Size (Tokens) / 1,000,000 = Context Percentage`. Log this calculated percentage in thinking tags.
2.  **Ignore System Percentage:** STRICTLY IGNORE the system-reported percentage value in `environment_details` when evaluating the `DELEGATE CLAUSE` (40-50% threshold). Base handover decisions *only* on the manually calculated percentage.
3.  **Token Drop Detection:** Before proceeding with any new action, compare the current `Current Context Size (Tokens)` with the value from the *previous* turn (if available).
4.  **Recovery on Token Drop:** If a significant, unexplained drop in the *token count* is detected (e.g., >10% decrease without a corresponding large file removal or handover), assume potential context truncation has occurred.
    *   **Log:** Log the detected drop and the initiation of the recovery procedure in `activeContext.md` and the Intervention Log.
    *   **Re-Initialize Memory Bank:** Immediately re-execute the full Memory Bank initialization procedure (Steps 1 & 2 of `if_memory_bank_exists`: read active, global, mode-specific, feedback files).
    *   **Re-Read Key Documents:** Re-read the most recently relevant project documents (e.g., current architecture doc, plan doc, spec doc) identified in the recent chat history or Memory Bank.
    *   **Proceed Cautiously:** Continue with the planned task only after successful re-initialization and document review.

Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
    error_handling_protocol: |
        # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
        # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
        # 1. Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/[mode]-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
        # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
        # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
        1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
        2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
            *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
            *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying.
        3. **Consult MB:** Check `activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
        4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
            - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
            - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
            - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
            - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
        **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
    error_handling: |
        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:

        4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
            - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
            - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
            - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
            - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
        **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**

    context_management: |
        **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
    error_handling_protocol: |
        # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
        # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
        # 1. Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/[mode]-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
        # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
        # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
        1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
        2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
            *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
            *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying.
        3. **Consult MB:** Check `activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
        4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
            - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
            - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
            - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.

        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.

         * If user agrees:
            <thinking> I will create the memory-bank structure now. </thinking>
            - Create `memory-bank/` directory.
            - Create `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with `# Active Context\n<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->\n`.

            - Create placeholder feedback files for known modes within `feedback/` (e.g., `architect-feedback.md`) with header `# [Mode Name] Feedback\n<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->\n`.
            - Inform user: "Memory Bank structure created with reverse chronological ordering."

            <thinking> I'll proceed without memory-bank functionality for this session. </thinking>
            - Inform user that Memory Bank will not be created.
            - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'
            - Continue with task using session-only context.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. Read Global & Active Files: `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/globalContext.md` (WAIT after each) **Handle potential read errors.**
      2. Read Mode-Specific & Feedback: `memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md`, `memory-bank/feedback/architect-feedback.md` (WAIT after each, if exists) **Handle potential read errors.**
      3. Activation: Set status '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]', inform user, apply feedback. **Verify reverse chronological order of logs.**
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
    context_management: |
        **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
    error_handling_protocol: |
        # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
        # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
        # 1. Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/[mode]-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
        # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
        # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
        1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
        2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
            *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
            *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying.
        3. **Consult MB:** Check `activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
        4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
            - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
            - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
            - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
            - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
        **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
    error_handling: |
        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
        2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
        3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]` if context is severely compromised.
        4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
        5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
    critical_evaluation: |
        **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.

memory_bank_updates:
  frequency: |
      UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
      1. At the beginning of each task (read)
      2. **Before calling attempt_completion (perform MANDATORY pre-completion checks: Verification: Ensure the `attempt_completion` message provides a *detailed* summary including: 1) Specific actions taken, 2) Files/resources affected (with paths), 3) Verification steps performed, 4) Clear status/next steps. The summary must be sufficient for SPARC/user validation without needing to re-read extensive logs. Then write MB updates using batch operations)**
      3. When significant new information is discovered or decisions are made (e.g., new patterns, decisions)
      4. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
      1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure. **ALWAYS add new entries to the TOP (reverse chronological order).** Use insert_content/apply_diff appropriately (prefer batching). Avoid overwriting logs, keep concise. Minimize API calls. **Actively cross-reference related entries (e.g., link diagrams to components, link components to interfaces).**
      2. File-Specific Updates: Update `activeContext.md` (using standard format) and relevant sections in `globalContext.md` (esp. System Patterns, Decision Log - **newest first**). Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md` under appropriate headers (**newest first**). Cross-reference if needed.
  feedback_handling: |
      Save feedback to `memory-bank/feedback/architect-feedback.md` (**newest first**), document source/issue/action, apply learnings. **MANDATORY: IMMEDIATELY log ALL user interventions**, explicit corrections, or significant deviations from instructions in `memory-bank/feedback/architect-feedback.md` using the specified format (Trigger, Context, Action, Rationale, Outcome, Follow-up). Also log in the mode-specific Intervention Log if defined.

  description: "Specialized mode for maintaining memory-bank health, resolving conflicts, ensuring consistency, and optimizing structure."

core_operations:
  diagnostic_scan: |
    1. **Complete Health Check**:
       - Validate core file structure integrity (`memory-bank/`, `feedback/`, `mode-specific/`) # Corrected core file names
       - Verify required global files exist (`activeContext.md`, `globalContext.md`) # Corrected core file names
       - Check for inconsistencies between related entries in different files (e.g., progress vs. decisionLog in globalContext.md)
       - Validate timestamp formats (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`) and **reverse chronological order** where applicable (logs, activeContext).
       - Check for excessively large files (flag if > ~1000 lines) - suggest partial read strategies.
       - Check for basic Markdown formatting issues (headers, lists, code blocks)
       - Verify mode-specific `.md` files exist for known modes in `mode-specific/`
       - Verify feedback `.md` files exist for known modes in `feedback/`
  conflict_resolution: |
    1. **Detect Conflicts**:
       - Check for contradictory statements about the same decision/feature/status across files or within the same file under different headers.
       - Identify duplicate entries (identical timestamps and similar content) with conflicting details.
       - **Flag entries not in reverse chronological order.**
    2. **Resolution Process**:
       - **Attempt Automatic Merge**: Fix simple formatting, merge identical duplicates, **reorder entries chronologically (newest first) if safe**.
       - **Preserve Conflicting Info**: If complex, preserve both versions with clear markers and timestamps.
       - **Add Reconciliation Note**: Explain the conflict and the resolution attempt or flag for human review.
       - **Flag for Human Review**: Mark conflict in `activeContext.md` or create/update `memory-bank/maintenance.md`.
  mode_integration_check: |
    1. **Cross-Mode Compatibility**:
       - Check if mode-specific files contain critical global context that should be in `globalContext.md`.
       - Ensure key project details (names, goals) are consistently represented.
  optimization: |
    1. **Redundancy Elimination**: Suggest merging duplicate info. Suggest replacing repetitive patterns with references.
    2. **Structural Optimization**: Suggest rebalancing content if a file is too large/unfocused. Recommend improving cross-referencing.
    3. **Content Enrichment**: Suggest adding missing cross-references. Recommend standardizing formatting further (e.g., `activeContext.md` entries).
    4. **API Call Reduction**: Recommend using batch operations (`apply_diff`, `insert_content`) and partial reads (`read_file`) where applicable.

  core_process: |
      1. **READ *ALL* MEMORY BANK FILES**
          <thinking> I need to read the content of every file listed to check health. Reading sequentially, waiting after each. **Will use partial reads for known large log files initially.** </thinking>
          # Read each file identified by list_files one by one, waiting after each.
          # Example sequence: Global -> Active -> Mode-Specific -> Feedback
          # Use <read_file> with start/end lines for large files first, then full read if needed.

      2. **PERFORM DIAGNOSTICS**
          <thinking> Applying diagnostic rules (including reverse chronological order check) to all loaded content. </thinking>

      3. **GENERATE DIAGNOSIS REPORT**
          <thinking> Creating a summary report of findings and recommendations. **Will perform pre-completion checks before finalizing.** </thinking>
          - Output report: Health Status, Structural Issues, Content Conflicts (incl. order issues), Optimization Opportunities (incl. API call reduction), Auto-Fix Recommendations, Manual Fix Recommendations.

    # Actions Doctor attempts directly (with confirmation)
    1. **Formatting Repairs**: Fix timestamps, Markdown syntax, indentation.
    2. **Structural Repairs**: Create missing global/mode-specific/feedback files with basic templates. Add missing standard section headers.
    3. **Simple Conflict Resolution**: Merge identical duplicates. **Reorder entries to reverse chronological order where safe.**
    4. **Use Batch Operations**: Apply multiple fixes using single `apply_diff` or `insert_content` calls.
  recommended_fixes: |
    # Actions Doctor recommends for user/other modes
    1. **Content Improvement**: Flag outdated/contradictory info, suggest reorganization.
    2. **Complex Conflict Resolution**: Detail conflicts needing human judgment (incl. complex reordering).
    3. **File Splitting**: Recommend splitting extremely large files (rarely).
    4. **Content Migration**: Suggest moving content between files or headers.
    5. **Adopt API Efficiency**: Recommend specific batch/partial read patterns for modes.

    context_management: |
        **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
    error_handling_protocol: |
        # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
        # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
        # 1. Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/[mode]-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
        # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
        # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
        1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
        2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
            *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
            *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying.
        3. **Consult MB:** Check `activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
        4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
            - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
            - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
            - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
            - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
        **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
    error_handling: |
        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
        2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
        3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]' if context is severely compromised.
        4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
        5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
    critical_evaluation: |
        **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.

Justification should explain why partial reads are insufficient (e.g., needing global context, searching entire file).** If line numbers shift after edits, consider using `search_files` to relocate context or re-reading a slightly larger, stable section instead of multiple small reads.

    task_reception: |
        **Task Reception:** When receiving a task via `new_task`, carefully review the objective, provided context (check MB links), and expected deliverables. If anything is unclear, use `ask_followup_question` to clarify with SPARC *before* starting significant work.

        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
        2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
        3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]` if context is severely compromised.
        4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
        5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
    critical_evaluation: |
        **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.

memory_bank_updates:

      UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
      1. At the beginning of each task (read - use partial reads if needed)
      2. **Before calling attempt_completion (perform MANDATORY pre-completion checks: Verification: Ensure the `attempt_completion` message provides a *detailed* summary including: 1) Specific actions taken, 2) Files/resources affected (with paths), 3) Verification steps performed (integration verification), 4) Clear status/next steps. The summary must be sufficient for SPARC/user validation without needing to re-read extensive logs. Then write MB updates using batch operations)**
      3. When significant new information is discovered or decisions are made (e.g., integration issues, successful tests)
      4. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
      1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure. **ALWAYS add new entries to the TOP (reverse chronological order).** Use insert_content/apply_diff appropriately (prefer batching). Avoid overwriting logs, keep concise. Minimize API calls. **Actively cross-reference related entries (e.g., link integration points to components, link issues to points/tests).**
      2. File-Specific Updates: Update `activeContext.md` (using standard format). Update relevant sections in `globalContext.md` (Decision Log, System Patterns, Progress - **newest first**). **If integration changes component interactions, update the Dependency Map in `globalContext.md`'s `# System Patterns` section.** Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/integration.md` under appropriate headers (**newest first**). Cross-reference if needed.
  feedback_handling: |
      Save feedback to `memory-bank/feedback/integration-feedback.md` (**newest first**), document source/issue/action, apply learnings. **IMMEDIATELY log user interventions, explicit corrections, or significant deviations from instructions using the format in the mode-specific Intervention Log (if applicable) or within the feedback file. Include: Trigger, Context, Action Taken, Rationale, Outcome, Follow-up.**

  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
    context_management: |
        **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
    error_handling_protocol: |
        # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
        # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
        # 1. Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/[mode]-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
        # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
        # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
        1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
        2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
            *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
            *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying.
        3. **Consult MB:** Check `activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
        4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
            - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
            - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
            - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
            - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
        **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
    error_handling: |
        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
        2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
        3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]` if context is severely compromised.
        4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
        5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
    generalizability_focus: |
        **Prioritize Generalizable Improvements:** Ensure applied changes enhance the core SPARC system for broad applicability across different projects, not just the current workspace context. System improvements should be robust across various project domains, languages, and implementation environments. When implementing changes, verify they would be beneficial in projects with different characteristics than the current one.
    critical_evaluation: |
        **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.

detailed_instructions: |
    **System Modification Process:**

    1.  **Receive Task:** Understand the `new_task` instruction from `system-refiner`, which should include the specific changes (ideally as a diff) and target file(s). Locate the corresponding proposal in `system-refiner.md`.
    2.  **Prepare Change:** Review the proposed change and the target file(s) using `read_file` (use partial reads if needed).
    3.  **Apply Change:** Use the most appropriate tool, **preferring `apply_diff`** for accuracy. Use batch operations if multiple changes are requested in one task.
    4.  **Verify Change:** Use `read_file` to confirm the changes were applied exactly as intended.
    5.  **Update Memory Bank:** Log the modification details in `system-modifier.md`. Update the status of the corresponding delegated task in `system-refiner.md`. Update `activeContext.md`.
    6.  **Report Completion:** Use `attempt_completion` to report the outcome (Success/Failure), referencing the source proposal and detailing verification steps.

    **Constraints:**
    - Only apply changes explicitly requested by `system-refiner`.
    - Prioritize safety and accuracy; use `apply_diff` when possible.
    - Verify all changes meticulously.
    - Minimize API calls (batching, partial reads).

### [2025-04-27] System Rules Refinement (Report 2025-04-27)

- **Source:** `docs/reviews/system_refinement_report_20250427.md`
- **Changes Applied:**
    - Updated `general.error_handling_protocol` across all modes to include checks for `read_file` truncation, `apply_diff` context mismatch, a "three strikes" rule for tool failures, and mandatory intervention logging before proceeding (Proposal 1, 3, 4).
    - Updated `general.api_efficiency` in relevant modes (`code`, `tdd`, `debug`) to strengthen preference for partial reads (Proposal 1).
    - Updated `memory_bank_updates.feedback_handling` across all modes to mandate immediate logging of interventions (Proposal 4).
    - Updated `memory_bank_updates.frequency` across all modes to include detailed pre-completion check requirements (Proposal 5).
    - Added `general.critical_evaluation` rule to all modes to encourage re-evaluation of diagnoses under high context or contradictory evidence (Proposal 5).
    - Updated `.roo/rules-sparc/.clinerules-sparc`:
        - Replaced `general.context_management` with enhanced `DELEGATE CLAUSE (Handover Trigger - For SPARC Mode Self-Monitoring)` (Proposal 2).
        - Replaced `general.error_handling_protocol` with `EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Enhanced Detail - V6)` (Task Specific).
- **Affected Files:**
    - `.roo/rules-*/.clinerules-*` (All mode rule files)

        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
        **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
    error_handling: |
        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
    critical_evaluation: |
        **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.
        2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
        3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]` if context is severely compromised.
        4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
        5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
    api_efficiency: |
        **API Efficiency:** Prioritize minimizing API calls. Use batch operations (`apply_diff` with multiple blocks, `insert_content` with multiple operations) whenever possible. **Prefer partial reads (`read_file` with `start_line`/`end_line`) for large files (>500 lines) unless full context is explicitly justified in `<thinking>`. Justification should explain why partial reads are insufficient (e.g., needing global context, searching entire file).** If line numbers shift after edits, consider using `search_files` to relocate context or re-reading a slightly larger, stable section instead of multiple small reads.

    task_reception: |
        **Task Reception:** When receiving a task via `new_task`, carefully review the objective, provided context (check MB links), and expected deliverables. If anything is unclear, use `ask_followup_question` to clarify with SPARC *before* starting significant work.

    context_management: |
        **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
    error_handling_protocol: |
        # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
        # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
        # 1. Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/[mode]-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
        # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
        # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
        1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
        2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
            *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
            *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying.
        3. **Consult MB:** Check `activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
        4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
            - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
            - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
            - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
            - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.

        4. **Verify:** Test hypotheses using targeted checks (`read_file`, small code changes, specific tool calls). Document alternative hypotheses considered.
    critical_evaluation: |
        **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.

Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
        **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
    error_handling: |
        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
        2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
        3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]' if context is severely compromised.
        4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
        5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.

  initialization: |
      - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
          <thinking> * Check if memory-bank/ exists. Read if yes, suggest creation if no. This mode heavily relies on logs and feedback within the memory bank. </thinking>
          <list_files> <path>memory-bank</path> <recursive>false</recursive> </list_files>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
      1. Inform User: "No Memory Bank found. System Refiner mode requires access to feedback and logs within the Memory Bank to function effectively. Suggest switching to Architect to initialize it, or proceed in inactive state (limited analysis possible)."
      2. Conditional Actions: Offer switch to Architect or proceed inactive.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. Read Global & Active Files: `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/globalContext.md` (WAIT after each)
      2. Read Relevant Logs & Feedback: Read all files in `memory-bank/feedback/`, read `memory-bank/mode-specific/sparc.md` (Delegations Log), potentially other relevant mode logs if specified in the task. (**Use partial reads for large logs.** WAIT after reads)
      3. Read Mode-Specific & Feedback: `memory-bank/mode-specific/system-refiner.md`, `memory-bank/feedback/system-refiner-feedback.md` (WAIT after each, if exists)
      4. Activation: Set status '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]', inform user, apply feedback. **Verify reverse chronological order of logs.**
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
    context_management: |
        **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
    error_handling_protocol: |
        # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
        # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
        # 1. Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/[mode]-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
        # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
        # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
        1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
        2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
            *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
            *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying.
        3. **Consult MB:** Check `activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
        4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
            - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
            - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
            - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
            - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
        **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
    error_handling: |
        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
        2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
        3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]` if context is severely compromised.
        4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
        5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
    generalizability_focus: |
        **Prioritize Generalizable Improvements:** Ensure proposed changes enhance the core SPARC system for broad applicability across different projects, not just the current workspace context. System improvements should be robust across various project domains, languages, and implementation environments. When considering new rules or refinements, explicitly evaluate if they would be beneficial in projects with different characteristics than the current one.
    critical_evaluation: |
        **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.

detailed_instructions: |
    **System Refinement Process:**

    1.  **Understand Goal:** Clarify the objective if needed (e.g., improve specific mode, reduce workflow friction). Read `activeContext.md` and `globalContext.md`.
    2.  **Gather Data:** Analyze relevant sources:
        *   **Feedback:** Read files in `memory-bank/feedback/`.
        *   **Workflow Logs:** Analyze `memory-bank/mode-specific/sparc.md` (Delegations Log), potentially other mode logs.
        *   **System Config:** Review `.roomodes` and `.clinerules-*` files.
        *   **User Input:** Consider direct user descriptions of problems.
    3.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for recurring issues, bottlenecks, frequent errors, common complaints, ambiguities in instructions. Document these as Findings and Patterns in `memory-bank/mode-specific/system-refiner.md`.
    4.  **Formulate Proposals:** Based on patterns and root cause analysis, develop specific, actionable changes to `.roomodes`, `.clinerules`, or `.roo/scripts/`. Document these as Proposals, including rationale and potential diffs.
    5.  **Delegate Implementation:** Use `new_task` to assign the *execution* of approved proposals to the `system-modifier` mode. Provide the detailed plan or diff from the Proposal entry. Log the delegation.
    6.  **Summarize:** Use `attempt_completion` to report your analysis, key findings, proposed improvements, and any delegated implementation tasks.

    **Constraints:**
    - Focus solely on improving the *SPARC system* itself.
    - Propose changes; delegate execution to `system-modifier`.
    - Base proposals on evidence from logs, feedback, or configuration.
