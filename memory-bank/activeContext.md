# Active Context
[2025-05-11 04:15:34] - SPARC - User Intervention - User informed SPARC that Git repository is already initialized. Task for `devops` mode will be adjusted to remove Git initialization.
[2025-05-11 04:09:30] - SPARC - CRITICAL USER INTERVENTION - SPARC attempted to re-delegate a COMPLETED task to `spec-pseudocode`. User correctly pointed out that `spec-pseudocode` had already returned a successful completion with the revised specification ([`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md)). SPARC failed to process this result. Corrective action: Log critical error. Review `spec-pseudocode`'s completion message and indicated files to determine next valid step.
[2025-05-11 04:08:04] - SPARC - User Intervention - User denied `new_task` to `spec-pseudocode` a third time, requesting "MORE DETAILS". Corrective action: Log intervention. Will make the next delegation to `spec-pseudocode` exhaustively detailed, referencing specific line numbers or sections in the guidance documents where possible, and explicitly list out categories of parameters to be updated.
[2025-05-11 04:03:07] - SpecPseudo - Action - Successfully revised [`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md) with complete content, prioritizing deterministic defaults for Unified Quantity Specification, per user feedback.
[2025-05-11 03:38:47] - SpecPseudo - Action - Revised [`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md) to incorporate Unified Quantity Specification pattern.
[2025-05-11 03:31:13] - SPARC - User Intervention - User denied `new_task` to `spec-pseudocode` again, requesting "MORE DETAILS". Corrective action: Log intervention, further refine delegation instructions for `spec-pseudocode` to be exceptionally explicit.
[2025-05-11 03:29:27] - SPARC - User Intervention - User denied `new_task` to `spec-pseudocode`. Reason: SPARC did not read architect's output documents before creating delegation. Corrective action: Log intervention, read docs, then re-delegate.
[2025-05-11 03:28:17] - SPARC - Architect mode completed architectural revision for "Unified Quantity Specification". New guidance doc at [`docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md`](docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md). Delegating to `spec-pseudocode` for specification update.
[2025-05-11 03:00:20] - Architect - Further Refinement - Updated [`docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md`](docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md) to include a justification for why reforming the existing specification is preferred over a fresh start. This addresses user feedback ([`memory-bank/feedback/architect-feedback.md:3`](memory-bank/feedback/architect-feedback.md:3)).
[2025-05-11 02:57:40] - Architect - Refined Guidance - Created detailed guidance document [`docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md`](docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md) for `spec-pseudocode` mode on how to apply the "Unified Quantity Specification" to [`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md). This addresses user feedback ([`memory-bank/feedback/architect-feedback.md:3`](memory-bank/feedback/architect-feedback.md:3)) requesting more explicit instructions.
[2025-05-11 02:35:00] - Architect - Architectural Revision - Proposed "Unified Quantity Specification" to allow deterministic, ranged, or probabilistic counts for sub-elements in `synthetic_test_data` package. Updated System Patterns, Decision Log in [`memory-bank/globalContext.md`](memory-bank/globalContext.md) and Data Models in [`memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md`](memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md). This addresses feedback from [`memory-bank/feedback/spec-pseudocode-feedback.md:3`](memory-bank/feedback/spec-pseudocode-feedback.md:3).
[2025-05-11 02:24:17] - SPARC - Early Return from `spec-pseudocode` - Specification at [`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md) requires architectural revision for deterministic element counts. Delegating to `architect`. See feedback in [`memory-bank/feedback/spec-pseudocode-feedback.md:3`](memory-bank/feedback/spec-pseudocode-feedback.md:3).
[2025-05-11 02:01:22] - SPARC - User Intervention - User denied `new_task` to `spec-pseudocode` due to insufficient detail in initial request. Re-delegating with enhanced instructions.
[2025-05-11 02:14:27] - SpecPseudo - Action - Drafted comprehensive specification document for Synthetic Data Package in specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md.
