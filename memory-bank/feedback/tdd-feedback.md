### [2025-05-11 14:21:00] - TDD - Early Return Invoked
- **Trigger**: Repeated `apply_diff` failures and high context usage (48%).
- **Blocker**: Persistent failures using the `apply_diff` tool to modify the `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` method in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1). The root cause of these failures was not consistently re-reading the file with `read_file` immediately before constructing the `SEARCH` block for `apply_diff`, especially after interruptions or previous `apply_diff` issues. This led to `SEARCH` blocks not matching the actual file content.
- **Progress Before Blocker**:
    - Successfully added and ran three new tests for `EpubGenerator` (`test_generate_unified_quantity_chapters_exact`, `_range`, `_probabilistic`) in [`tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py:1). These tests passed without new code, confirming existing robustness for `chapters_config`.
    - Added `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_exact` to [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1).
    - Implemented `_determine_count` in [`synth_data_gen/core/base.py`](synth_data_gen/core/base.py:1).
    - Added placeholder `_add_pdf_chapter_content` to [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:1) and refactored `_create_pdf_text_single_column` to use it. The `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_exact` for PDF now passes.
    - Corrected `AttributeError: module 'unittest' has no attribute 'mock'` in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1) by fixing imports.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker**: Multiple `apply_diff` attempts were made to refactor the mocking strategy in `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range`. Each failed due to `SEARCH` block mismatches, stemming from not using fresh file reads.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The primary issue is a procedural error: failing to obtain the exact current file content for the `SEARCH` block of `apply_diff` immediately before its use. High context (48%) may also be contributing to difficulty in accurately constructing complex diffs.
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: The last attempt involved re-reading the file section, but the subsequent `apply_diff` was still formulated incorrectly or against a slightly diverged mental model of the file state.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 48%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps**:
    1.  **Delegate Task**: Create a new task for a fresh `tdd` instance (or `code` mode) with a clear context to specifically fix the `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` method in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1).
    2.  **Targeted Fix**: The fix should focus on:
        *   Removing the `@patch.object(PdfGenerator, '_determine_count')` decorator.
        *   Ensuring `@patch('synth_data_gen.core.base.random.randint')` is used, and the mock argument (`mock_base_randint`) is correctly passed and used.
        *   Removing any `mock_determine_count` parameter from the method signature and any related lines like `mock_determine_count.side_effect = None`.
        *   Removing the assertion `self.assertIn(call(chapters_range_config, "chapters"), mock_determine_count.call_args_list)`.
        *   Ensuring `mock_base_randint.assert_called_once_with(chapters_range_config["min"], chapters_range_config["max"])` is correctly implemented.
    3.  **Provide Exact Context**: The new task should be provided with the exact current content of the `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` method (and its decorators) from [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:180-230) (lines 180-230 based on the last `read_file` output) to serve as an accurate `SEARCH` block.
    4.  **Resume TDD**: Once this specific test is fixed and passing, TDD can resume with the probabilistic case for `PdfGenerator.chapters_config`, then move to `MarkdownGenerator`, and other objectives.
