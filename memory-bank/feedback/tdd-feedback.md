### [2025-05-11 23:00:00] - TDD - CRITICAL Blocker & Early Return: Persistent Test Discovery Failure
- **Trigger**: Multiple failed attempts to get new tests (`test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic`, `test_generate_frontmatter_json_basic`) in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` to be discovered and fail as expected. Context at 41%.
- **Context**:
    - User feedback confirmed file length and test presence.
    - Duplicate TOML test method was removed.
    - Indentation of remaining TOML and new JSON test methods verified and corrected.
    - Assertions for TOML and JSON tests were made more stringent to ensure failure if SUT produces YAML.
- **Problem**:
    - Running `unittest discover tests/generators/` consistently reports "Ran 49 tests ... OK", indicating the new tests are either not being run or are incorrectly passing.
    - Running tests individually or by class (`TestMarkdownGenerator`) previously resulted in `AttributeError: type object 'TestMarkdownGenerator' has no attribute 'test_name'` or only ran the original 5 tests in that file.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Previous assumptions that this was a simple indentation or file content issue were incorrect. The problem is a persistent test discovery/execution anomaly with `unittest` in this environment for newly added methods in this specific file, despite them appearing structurally correct.
- **Attempts**: Numerous `read_file`, `apply_diff`, `insert_content`, `write_to_file`, and various `execute_command` for `unittest` (direct, class, discover with/without patterns).
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The root cause of `unittest`'s failure to discover/run these specific new tests correctly is unknown and beyond the capability to diagnose with current tools and TDD scope. It might be Python/unittest caching, a subtle environment issue, or a non-obvious conflict.
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: Varied test execution commands, file content normalization, indentation correction, assertion strengthening.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 41%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for SPARC/User/Debugger)**:
    1.  **Manual Investigation**: Manually run `python3 -m unittest -v tests.generators.test_markdown_generator.TestMarkdownGenerator.test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` (and for JSON) in a fresh terminal. Check for any environment variables or `__pycache__` issues that might interfere.
    2.  **Simplify Further**: Temporarily comment out *all other tests* in `test_markdown_generator.py` except for `setUp`, `tearDown`, and the `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` to see if it gets discovered and runs in isolation.
    3.  **Delegate to Debug**: If the issue persists, delegate to `debug` mode for a focused investigation on Python's `unittest` discovery and execution behavior in this specific file and environment.
    4.  **Alternative Test Runner**: Consider if `pytest` (mentioned in global context as a future enhancement) might behave differently and if a temporary switch for this file is feasible for debugging discovery.
- **Files Affected**: `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`, `memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md`.
### [2025-05-11 22:59:00] - TDD - User Intervention: Indentation of New Frontmatter Tests
- **Trigger**: User feedback after task interruption and previous `apply_diff`.
- **Context**: Agent had removed a duplicate `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` and was about to run tests. User indicated that the remaining TOML and the new JSON test methods might still have incorrect indentation, preventing discovery.
- **Action**: Acknowledged. Will re-read the file sections for both `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` and `test_generate_frontmatter_json_basic` to verify and correct indentation if necessary.
- **Rationale**: User's guidance suggests that previous file operations might not have left both methods correctly indented for `unittest` discovery.
- **Outcome**: Will ensure both test methods are correctly structured before attempting to run them.
- **Follow-up**: Re-read relevant sections of `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` and apply diffs if needed.
### [2025-05-11 22:57:00] - TDD - User Intervention: Test Method Location Clarification
- **Trigger**: User feedback after `ask_followup_question` regarding test discovery.
- **Context**: Agent was struggling with `AttributeError` and `unittest` not discovering newly added frontmatter tests (`toml`, `json`) in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`. Agent suspected file corruption or complex discovery issues.
- **User Guidance**: User indicated the tests are present in the file within lines 1111-1189.
- **Action**: Acknowledged error in understanding file state/line numbers after previous operations. Will re-read the specified section to get an accurate view.
- **Rationale**: User's direct pointer to the lines suggests the methods exist in the file, and the problem might be more nuanced than simple absence or gross misplacement.
- **Outcome**: Will help re-evaluate the test discovery problem with accurate file context.
- **Follow-up**: Re-read `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` lines 1111-1189.
### [2025-05-11 22:45:00] - TDD - Blocker: Test Discovery Failure for `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic`
- **Trigger**: Persistent `AttributeError` and 0 tests found by `discover` when targeting `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic`.
- **Context**: After multiple attempts to add and correct the `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` method in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` (including `insert_content`, `apply_diff` for indentation, and `write_to_file` to ensure clean content), the `unittest` framework consistently fails to discover this specific test method. Running the test directly results in `AttributeError: type object 'TestMarkdownGenerator' has no attribute 'test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic'`. Running `unittest discover -p '*toml_basic.py' -s tests/generators/` (note: pattern should have been for the method, not file) also found 0 tests. Running the entire class `TestMarkdownGenerator` only finds the original 5 tests.
- **Analysis**: The cause is unclear. File content and structure appear correct. This might be an obscure issue with the test runner's discovery mechanism in this environment, a non-visible character, or a subtle naming conflict not immediately apparent.
- **Action**: Will attempt to add the *next* planned test (for JSON frontmatter) to see if the discovery issue is specific to the TOML test or affects any new test added to this file.
- **Follow-up**: If the JSON test is also undiscoverable, this points to a more significant problem with the test file or environment.
### [2025-05-11 22:43:00] - TDD - User Intervention: Incorrect File Length Assumption
- **Trigger**: User feedback after `ask_followup_question`.
- **Context**: Multiple attempts to add `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` to `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` failed with `AttributeError` (test not found). This was due to misinterpreting truncated `read_file` outputs and assuming a file length (around 1254 lines) that was much longer than the actual file length (1153 lines). Operations were targeted at non-existent lines or outside the class structure.
- **Action**: Acknowledged error. Will re-read the file to ascertain correct structure and insertion points.
- **Rationale**: User correctly identified that the agent was operating with an incorrect understanding of the file's true length.
- **Outcome**: Prevents further erroneous file operations.
- **Follow-up**: Re-read `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` to determine the correct insertion point for the new test method.
### [2025-05-11 22:05:39] - TDD - Early Return Invoked (Context Size)
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 42%, approaching the 40-50% threshold for proactive Early Return.
- **Blocker**: No specific code blocker. Early return is due to context window management.
- **Progress Before Early Return**:
    - **`PdfGenerator`**:
        - Completed TDD cycles for `page_count_config` (probabilistic).
        - Implemented and tested routing based on `layout.columns`.
        - Verified `running_header.enable` functionality (existing code was correct).
        - Implemented and tested `visual_toc.enable` routing and fallback.
        - Implemented and tested `pdf_tables_occurrence_config` (exact count) within the `single_column_text` variant.
        - Implemented and tested `pdf_figures_occurrence_config` (exact count) within the `single_column_text` variant.
    - **`MarkdownGenerator`**:
        - Created test file `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`.
        - Corrected `get_default_specific_config` to align with Unified Quantity Specification for several fields.
        - Implemented and tested `headings_config.count` (exact) in `_create_md_basic_elements_content`.
        - Implemented and tested `md_list_items_config.count` (exact) in `_create_md_basic_elements_content`.
        - Implemented and tested `md_images_config.count` (exact) in `_create_md_basic_elements_content`.
        - Implemented and tested `gfm_features.md_tables_occurrence_config.count` (exact) in `_create_md_extended_elements_content`.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker**: N/A.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: N/A.
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: N/A.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 42%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for new TDD agent instance)**:
    1.  **Continue `MarkdownGenerator` `generate()` Tests**:
        *   Implement range and probabilistic tests for `headings_config`, `md_list_items_config`, `md_images_config`.
        *   Test other GFM features: `md_footnotes_occurrence_config`, `md_task_lists_occurrence_config`, `md_code_blocks_config` (exact, range, probabilistic for each).
        *   Test `frontmatter` settings (all styles: yaml, toml, json; various field combinations).
    2.  **Continue `PdfGenerator` `generate()` Tests**:
        *   Test remaining `pdf_specific_settings` like `running_header` content variations, `visual_toc` depth, and more detailed `table_generation` and `figure_generation` parameters (e.g., specific table content, figure captions, different occurrence types).
    3.  **Begin `EpubGenerator` `generate()` Tests**:
        *   Start with basic configuration and gradually add tests for `epub_specific_settings` (e.g., `sections_per_chapter_config`, `notes_config`, `images_config`, etc.), ensuring "Unified Quantity Specification" is covered.
        *   Test styling and feature flags (ToC styles, note types, page numbering, multimedia).
    4.  **Systematic `epub_components` Unit Tests**:
        *   Create test files in `tests/generators/epub_components/` if they don't exist for each module in `synth_data_gen/generators/epub_components/`.
        *   Write detailed unit tests for public functions/classes within each component (e.g., `citations.py`, `content_types.py`, etc.). Expand tests for `toc.py`.
    5.  **Refine `EpubGenerator` Integration**: Iteratively refactor `EpubGenerator.generate()` to use the `epub_components` as their tests are developed.
    6.  **`ConfigLoader` Implementation and Testing**: Implement and test the full `ConfigLoader` class.
    7.  **Git**: Ensure all new/modified test and source code files are committed to Git in logical chunks. The last commit by this agent will include changes up to the GFM tables test for MarkdownGenerator.
    8.  **Memory Bank**: Continue to update Memory Bank files as per TDD rules.
- **Files Affected in this session (committed before this Early Return, or to be committed by SPARC if this is the last action)**:
    - `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`
    - `synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`
    - `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`
    - `synth_data_gen/generators/markdown.py`
    - `memory-bank/mode-specific/tdd.md` (updated multiple times)
    - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (will be updated by SPARC)
    - `memory-bank/globalContext.md` (will be updated by SPARC)
### [2025-05-11 21:41:29] - TDD - Early Return Invoked
- **Trigger**: User instruction to "probably early return" and context size at 47%.
- **Blocker**: The test `test_generate_single_column_page_count_range` in `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py` is failing with `TypeError: BaseGenerator._determine_count() missing 1 required positional argument: 'context_key_name'`. This occurred after attempting to use a `side_effect` to wrap the original `_determine_count` method to resolve a previous `TypeError` with `@patch.object(PdfGenerator, '_determine_count', wraps=PdfGenerator._determine_count)`. The current mocking strategy for spying on `_determine_count` while also controlling the behavior of `random.randint` within it is problematic.
- **Progress Before Blocker**:
    - Successfully added and passed tests for `chapters_config` (exact, range, probabilistic) in `PdfGenerator`.
    - Successfully added and passed test for `page_count_config` (exact integer) in `PdfGenerator`.
    - Added test for `page_count_config` (range) in `PdfGenerator` which is currently failing.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker**:
    - Initial attempt used `@patch.object(PdfGenerator, '_determine_count', wraps=PdfGenerator._determine_count)` which led to a `TypeError`.
    - Current attempt uses `@patch.object(PdfGenerator, '_determine_count')` and sets `side_effect` to a function that calls `BaseGenerator._determine_count(self.generator, ...)`. This also results in a `TypeError` indicating `context_key_name` is missing.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The interaction between mocking `PdfGenerator._determine_count` (to assert it's called with specific parameters like "page_count") and also needing `BaseGenerator._determine_count` to execute its internal logic (which calls the patched `random.randint`) is complex. The `wraps` argument and the manual `side_effect` approach have both led to TypeErrors related to argument passing to the wrapped/original method.
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: Switched from `wraps` to a manual `side_effect` to call the original method. Added import for `BaseGenerator`.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 47%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps**:
    1.  **Delegate Task**: Create a new task for a fresh `tdd` instance (or `debug` mode) to specifically fix the `test_generate_single_column_page_count_range` method in `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`.
    2.  **Targeted Fix**: The fix should focus on ensuring that `_determine_count` is called correctly with `page_count_range_config` and `"page_count"`, and that `random.randint` (mocked as `mock_base_randint`) is called with `page_count_range_config["min"]` and `page_count_range_config["max"]`. This might involve:
        *   Revisiting the mocking strategy for `_determine_count`. Perhaps only patch `synth_data_gen.core.base.random.randint` and then assert the calls to the *actual* `self.generator._determine_count` if the goal is to ensure it's called with the right high-level config, and separately trust `BaseGenerator._determine_count` to use `randint` correctly (as it's tested elsewhere).
        *   Alternatively, if spying on the call to `PdfGenerator._determine_count` is essential, ensure the `side_effect` or `wraps` correctly passes all arguments.
    3.  **Provide Exact Context**: The new task should be provided with the current content of `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py` and `synth_data_gen/core/base.py`.
    4.  **Resume TDD**: Once this specific test is fixed and passing, TDD can resume with the probabilistic case for `PdfGenerator.page_count_config`.
[2025-05-11 21:18:00] - TDD - Early Return Follow-up - Resolved
- **Trigger**: Current task completion.
- **Context**: This entry follows up on the Early Return documented at "[2025-05-11 14:21:00] - TDD - Early Return Invoked".
- **Action**: The specific task to refactor `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` in `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py` was successfully completed.
- **Rationale**: The refactoring addressed the incorrect mocking strategy and persistent `apply_diff` failures by:
    1. Correctly structuring the `specific_config`, `global_config`, and `output_path` for the `generate()` call.
    2. Temporarily removing the instance-level `_determine_count` mock to allow the `BaseGenerator`'s method (which uses the patched `random.randint`) to be called.
    3. Simplifying the `finally` block to robustly restore the mock. This required switching from `apply_diff` / `search_and_replace` to `write_to_file` due to persistent tool matching issues with the `finally` block's structure.
- **Outcome**: `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` now passes. All tests in `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py` pass. Changes committed (60f9ddd). The blocker from the previous session is resolved.
- **Follow-up**: None required for this specific issue.
[2025-05-11 21:10:47] - TDD - Task Completion - Successfully fixed `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` in `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`.
    - Trigger: User task to fix specific failing test method.
    - Context: Previous Early Return due to `apply_diff` issues.
    - Action:
        1. Read file `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py` to get current content for the method.
        2. Applied `apply_diff` to correct mocking logic and remove outdated comments in `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range`.
        3. Ran the specific test: `python3 -m unittest tests.generators.test_pdf_generator.TestPdfGenerator.test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` - PASSED.
        4. Ran all tests in the file: `python3 -m unittest tests.generators.test_pdf_generator.TestPdfGenerator` - PASSED (10 tests).
        5. Committed changes: `git add tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py && git commit -m "fix(tests): Correct mocking for chapters_config range test in PdfGenerator"` (commit `885780d`).
    - Rationale: Followed user instructions and TDD feedback log to resolve the test failure.
    - Outcome: Test fixed, all related tests pass, changes committed.
    - Follow-up: Task complete.
# TDD Feedback
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->
### [2025-05-11 14:21:00] - TDD - Early Return Invoked
- **Trigger**: Repeated `apply_diff` failures and high context usage (48%).
- **Blocker**: Persistent failures using the `apply_diff` tool to modify the `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` method in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1). The root cause of these failures was not consistently re-reading the file with `read_file` immediately before constructing the `SEARCH` block for `apply_diff`, especially after interruptions or previous `apply_diff` issues. This led to `SEARCH` blocks not matching the actual file content.
- **Progress Before Blocker**:
    - Successfully added and ran three new tests for `EpubGenerator` (`test_generate_unified_quantity_chapters_exact`, `_range`, `_probabilistic`) in [`tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py:1). These tests passed without new code, confirming existing robustness for `chapters_config`.
    - Added `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_exact` to [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1).
    - Implemented `_determine_count` in [`synth_data_gen/core/base.py`](synth_data_gen/core/base.py:1).
    - Added placeholder `_add_pdf_chapter_content` to [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:1) and refactored `_create_pdf_text_single_column` to use it. The `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_exact` for PDF now passes.
    - Corrected `AttributeError: module 'unittest' has no attribute 'mock'` in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1) by fixing imports.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker**: Multiple `apply_diff` attempts were made to refactor the mocking strategy in `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range`. Each failed due to `SEARCH` block mismatches, stemming from not using fresh file reads.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The primary issue is a procedural error: failing to obtain the exact current file content for the `SEARCH` block of `apply_diff` immediately before its use. High context (48%) may also be contributing to difficulty in accurately constructing complex diffs.
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: The last attempt involved re-reading the file section, but the subsequent `apply_diff` was still formulated incorrectly or against a slightly diverged mental model of the file state.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 48%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps**:
    1.  **Delegate Task**: Create a new task for a fresh `tdd` instance (or `code` mode) with a clear context to specifically fix the `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` method in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1).
    2.  **Targeted Fix**: The fix should focus on:
        *   Removing the `@patch.object(PdfGenerator, '_determine_count')` decorator.
        *   Ensuring `@patch('synth_data_gen.core.base.random.randint')` is used, and the mock argument (`mock_base_randint`) is correctly passed and used.
        *   Removing any `mock_determine_count` parameter from the method signature and any related lines like `mock_determine_count.side_effect = None`.
        *   Removing the assertion `self.assertIn(call(chapters_range_config, "chapters"), mock_determine_count.call_args_list)`.
        *   Ensuring `mock_base_randint.assert_called_once_with(chapters_range_config["min"], chapters_range_config["max"])` is correctly implemented.
    3.  **Provide Exact Context**: The new task should be provided with the exact current content of the `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` method (and its decorators) from [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:180-230) (lines 180-230 based on the last `read_file` output) to serve as an accurate `SEARCH` block.
    4.  **Resume TDD**: Once this specific test is fixed and passing, TDD can resume with the probabilistic case for `PdfGenerator.chapters_config`, then move to `MarkdownGenerator`, and other objectives.
