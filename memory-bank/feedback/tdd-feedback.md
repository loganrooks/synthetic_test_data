### [2025-05-16 02:30:28] - TDD - Early Return: `PdfGenerator` OCR Noise SUT Indentation Blocker
- **Task**: "TDD for `PdfGenerator` - Resume Complex Features (Watermark SUT &amp; Beyond)" (Delegation ID `[2025-05-16 02:12:00]`)
- **Progress**:
    - **Watermark Feature**:
        - SUT `_draw_watermark` in [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:487) implemented.
        - Test `test_generate_pdf_applies_watermark` in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:2174) refactored and passes.
    - **OCR Handwritten Annotations**:
        - Test `test_ocr_simulation_applies_annotations` in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:2025) updated (Red).
        - SUT `_apply_handwritten_annotation` in [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:342) implemented. Test passes (Green).
    - **OCR Noise Simulation (Salt-and-Pepper)**:
        - Added new test `test_ocr_simulation_applies_noise_salt_and_pepper` to [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1) (Red).
        - Attempted to modify SUT `_apply_ocr_noise` in [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:409).
- **Blocker**: Pylance indentation errors starting at line 448 of [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:448) (within `_apply_ocr_noise`) introduced by `apply_diff` for SUT modification.
- **Files Affected**:
    - [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:1) (SUT for watermark, annotations, attempted noise - has linting errors)
    - [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1) (tests for watermark, annotations, new noise test)
- **Context**: 43%
- **Recommendations**:
    1.  Delegate to `code` mode to fix indentation errors in `_apply_ocr_noise` in [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:409).
    2.  After fix, `tdd` mode should:
        - Run `PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py::test_ocr_simulation_applies_noise_salt_and_pepper` to confirm Red state.
        - Implement SUT logic for "salt-and-pepper" noise in `_apply_ocr_noise`.
        - Verify `test_ocr_simulation_applies_noise_salt_and_pepper` passes.
        - Resume TDD for custom margins (Task 5).
        - Continue with other complex `PdfGenerator` features (Task 6).
- **Self-Correction/Analysis**: The `apply_diff` tool, while reporting success, can sometimes introduce subtle formatting issues. Direct verification of file content or using `py_compile` after `apply_diff` might be beneficial for critical SUT changes.
### [2025-05-16 01:36:53] - TDD - Early Return: High Context after OCR Simulation Progress
- **Trigger**: Context reached 49% after completing TDD cycles for OCR accuracy, skew, and a placeholder for annotations.
- **Blocker**: High context approaching Early Return threshold (40-50%).
- **Progress Before Blocker**:
    - **OCR Accuracy**:
        - Corrected assertion in `test_ocr_simulation_applies_accuracy` ([`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1909)) to achieve a proper Red state. This involved multiple attempts to get the assertion logic and mock interactions correct.
        - Implemented SUT logic in `PdfGenerator._create_pdf_simulated_ocr_high_quality` ([`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:325)) by adding a `_degrade_text` helper method to apply character degradation based on `ocr_accuracy_level`.
        - Test `test_ocr_simulation_applies_accuracy` now passes.
    - **OCR Skew**:
        - Added new test `test_ocr_simulation_applies_skew` ([`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1977)) asserting `canvas.skew()` is called. Achieved Red state.
        - Implemented SUT logic in `_create_pdf_simulated_ocr_high_quality` to read `skew_chance` and `max_skew_angle`, and call `c.skew()` with random angles.
        - Test `test_ocr_simulation_applies_skew` now passes.
    - **OCR Annotations (Placeholder)**:
        - Added new test `test_ocr_simulation_applies_annotations` ([`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:2025)) mocking a new SUT method `_apply_handwritten_annotation` and asserting it's called. Achieved Red state.
        - Added placeholder `_apply_handwritten_annotation` method to SUT and called it from `_create_pdf_simulated_ocr_high_quality`.
        - Test `test_ocr_simulation_applies_annotations` now passes.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker**: N/A (Proactive Early Return due to context).
- **Analysis of Blocker**: Context management.
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: N/A.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 49%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for SPARC/User/New TDD instance)**:
    1.  **Full SUT for Annotations**: Implement the actual logic for `_apply_handwritten_annotation` in [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:325) (e.g., drawing text with specified font, random position/rotation). Update `test_ocr_simulation_applies_annotations` to verify more specific canvas calls (e.g., `setFont`, `drawString`, `rotate`, `translate`).
    2.  **TDD for Custom Margins**: Resume Task 3 from the original brief:
        *   **Red**: Modify SUT ([`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:1)) to begin *using* the `layout_settings.page_margins` values in `_create_pdf_text_single_column` (and other relevant variants). This should cause `test_generate_single_column_applies_custom_margins` ([`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:130)) to fail (it currently passes because the SUT only *expects* the keys but doesn't use them for `SimpleDocTemplate` margins yet).
        *   **Green**: Implement the full SUT logic to correctly parse and apply `page_margins` (converting mm to points for `reportlab`'s `SimpleDocTemplate` margins: `leftMargin`, `rightMargin`, `topMargin`, `bottomMargin`). Ensure `test_generate_single_column_applies_custom_margins` passes.
        *   **Refactor**: Refactor as needed.
    3.  **Continue Other Complex Features**: Proceed with Task 4 from the original brief (table content, page rotation, etc.).
- **Files Affected in this session**:
    - [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1)
    - [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:1)
    - All Memory Bank files.
### [2025-05-15 23:16:42] - TDD - Early Return: Persistent `apply_diff` Failure &amp; High Context
- **Trigger**: Seventh consecutive failure of `apply_diff` tool on `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py` with "Special marker '=======' found in your diff content" error. Context at 45%.
- **Blocker**: Intractable issue with `apply_diff` tool's parsing of the diff format, specifically the `=======` separator, preventing modification of `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py` to align with SUT changes for margin configuration. This blocks the TDD cycle for custom margins. Previous attempts with `search_and_replace` also failed due to regex complexity/errors. `write_to_file` was attempted but failed due to a missing `line_count` parameter, and re-attempting it with full file content is risky given the context size and previous errors in constructing the full content.
- **Progress Before Blocker**:
    - SUT ([`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:1)) was successfully modified using multiple `search_and_replace` calls to expect `layout_settings.page_margins` (with `_mm` suffixes) instead of `layout.margins_mm`.
    - Test `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py::test_generate_single_column_applies_custom_margins` was identified as needing update to provide this new config structure.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker**:
    - Multiple `apply_diff` attempts with single and multiple diff blocks, with and without escaping the `=======` separator, after re-reading file sections. All failed with the same parser error.
    - Attempted `write_to_file` for the test file, which failed due to missing `line_count`.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The `apply_diff` tool's parser appears to have a persistent issue with the `=======` separator in this context, or there's a subtle misunderstanding of its required format that isn't clarified by the error messages or documentation.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 45%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for SPARC/User/Debugger)**:
    1.  **Manual/Alternative Edit of Test File**: Manually edit `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py` for the `test_generate_single_column_applies_custom_margins` method (around lines 425-450) to:
        *   Change `custom_margins = {"top": 10, ...}` to `custom_page_margins = {"top_mm": 10, ...}`.
        *   Change `specific_config` to use `"layout_settings": {"columns": 1, "page_margins": custom_page_margins}`.
        *   Update `expected_left_margin` (and right, top, bottom) to use `custom_page_margins["left_mm"]` etc.
    2.  **Run Tests**: After manual correction, run `PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py::test_generate_single_column_applies_custom_margins`. It should now pass as the SUT changes are already in place.
    3.  **Address Other Failures**: Investigate and fix the other 3 test failures reported in the last `execute_command` output (related to context keys "tables" vs "pdf_tables" and "figures" vs "pdf_figures", and the expected failure for figure caption content).
    4.  **Resume TDD**: Continue with the planned TDD for other complex `PdfGenerator` features.
- **Files Affected (SUT changes were successful, test file changes blocked)**:
    - [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:1) (successfully modified)
    - [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1) (modification attempts failed)
### [2025-05-15 14:07:00] - TDD - Blocker: `test_ligature_simulation_setting_is_respected` - `Paragraph` Mock Not Called
- **Trigger**: Persistent `AssertionError` in `test_ligature_simulation_setting_is_respected` ([`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1)). Debug print shows `mock_paragraph_class.call_args_list` is `[]`.
- **Blocker**: The `reportlab.platypus.Paragraph` class (mocked as `mock_paragraph_class`) is not being called at all during the test execution, despite the SUT appearing to have code paths that should instantiate it. This prevents verifying the current "Green" state of the test (with placeholder SUT method) and proceeding with ligature TDD.
- **Progress Before Blocker**:
    - Memory Bank initialized.
    - `_process_text_for_ligatures` method in [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:1) was confirmed to be incorrectly indented (outside the class) and was fixed using `apply_diff`.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker**:
    - Ran test: `AttributeError` for missing `_process_text_for_ligatures`.
    - Corrected SUT indentation for `_process_text_for_ligatures`.
    - Ran test: `AssertionError: Paragraph('figure flow field', <ANY>) call not found`.
    - Added `print` to test for `mock_paragraph_class.call_args_list`.
    - Ran test with `-s`: Output confirmed `call_args_list` is `[]`.
    - Changed assertion to check for the *first* expected `Paragraph` call (title paragraph): `AssertionError: Paragraph('Ligature Test', <ANY>) call not found` with `call_args_list` still `[]`.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The fact that `mock_paragraph_class.call_args_list` is empty indicates a fundamental issue. Either an unhandled exception is occurring in the SUT before any `Paragraph` object is created, or the `mocker.patch('reportlab.platypus.Paragraph')` is not effective. The `_determine_count` mock and its `side_effect` list is a potential area where an early exception might occur if misconfigured, preventing subsequent code execution.
- **Context %**: ~22%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps**: Delegate to `debug` mode.
    - **Objective for Debug**: Investigate why `reportlab.platypus.Paragraph` is not being called when `PdfGenerator.generate()` is executed by the test `test_ligature_simulation_setting_is_respected` in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1). Determine if an early exception (e.g., from `_determine_count` mock, or `SimpleDocTemplate` mock interaction) is preventing `Paragraph` instantiation, or if the mock patch for `Paragraph` is ineffective.
    - **Files for Debug**: [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1), [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:1).
### [2025-05-15 11:55:29] - TDD - Early Return: Persistent `StopIteration` with `_determine_count` Mock &amp; High Context
- **Trigger**: Persistent `StopIteration` error when testing `test_single_column_figure_caption_passed_to_method` after multiple attempts to correct mock `side_effect` for `_determine_count`. Context at 42%.
- **Blocker**: Inability to get the test `test_single_column_figure_caption_passed_to_method` into a "Red" state (failing due to SUT logic rather than test setup errors) because of the `StopIteration` error. The `side_effect` list for the `_determine_count` mock is being exhausted unexpectedly.
- **Progress Before Blocker**:
    - Successfully added and verified tests for Unified Quantity Specification for `page_count_config`, `pdf_tables_occurrence_config`, and `pdf_figures_occurrence_config` (exact, range, probabilistic).
    - Successfully added and verified tests for Layouts (column count and custom margins).
    - Successfully added and verified tests for Running Headers/Footers (enable/disable, content, font).
    - Successfully added and verified tests for Visual ToC (enable/disable, style, depth).
    - Successfully added and verified test for OCR Simulation settings passthrough.
    - Added test `test_single_column_figure_caption_passed_to_method`.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker**:
    - Corrected a `NameError` in the test.
    - Adjusted the `side_effect` list for the `_determine_count` mock from `[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]` to `[1, 1, 0, 1]`.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The `_determine_count` mock's `side_effect` iterator is not behaving as expected. The number of calls to `_determine_count` within the `_create_pdf_text_single_column` method (when a figure is being generated) seems to be more than the 4 explicitly accounted for in the `side_effect` list `[1, 1, 0, 1]`. This could be due to nested calls or an incorrect understanding of the call stack for this specific configuration.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 42%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for SPARC/User/Debugger)**:
    1.  **Delegate to Debug**: Create a new task for `debug` mode to:
        *   Investigate the exact call sequence and arguments for `_determine_count` within `PdfGenerator._create_pdf_text_single_column` when `specific_config` includes a figure to be generated.
        *   Determine the correct number of expected calls and their corresponding return values needed for the `side_effect` list in `test_single_column_figure_caption_passed_to_method`.
        *   Adjust the test's `side_effect` list so that the `StopIteration` error is resolved, allowing the test to fail for the intended reason (SUT not using caption).
    2.  **Provide Context**: The debugger should be provided with [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1) and [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:1).
    3.  **Resume TDD**: Once the test fails correctly, `tdd` mode can implement the SUT logic in `_add_pdf_figure_content` to use the caption.
- **Files Affected**: [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1).
### [2025-05-15 05:29:00] - TDD - Early Return: Indentation Issues &amp; High Context in `test_generate_epub3_with_ncx_only_config`
- **Trigger**: Persistent Pylance indentation errors in `tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py` after multiple `apply_diff` attempts. Context at 42%.
- **Blocker**: Inability to reliably correct indentation in the `test_generate_epub3_with_ncx_only_config` function using `apply_diff`. This prevents running the test to confirm its "Red" state for the NCX-only ToC logic.
- **Progress Before Blocker**:
    - Successfully completed Red/Green/Refactor cycle for `test_generate_epub_with_complex_config_and_interactions`.
    - Added new test `test_generate_epub3_navdoc_respects_max_depth_setting` and achieved "Green" state after SUT and test modifications.
    - Added new test `test_generate_epub3_with_ncx_only_config`.
    - Attempted to fix test setup for `test_generate_epub3_with_ncx_only_config` by modifying the `create_ncx_side_effect`.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker**:
    - Multiple `apply_diff` attempts to correct indentation within `test_generate_epub3_with_ncx_only_config`.
    - Re-read file sections to ensure `SEARCH` blocks were accurate.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The `apply_diff` tool seems to be struggling with precise indentation changes in this specific context, possibly due to subtle mismatches or the complexity of the diffs. High context might also be impairing the ability to formulate perfectly accurate diffs.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 42%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for SPARC/User/Debugger)**:
    1.  **Manual/IDE Indentation Fix**: Manually open `tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py` and correct all indentation errors within the `test_generate_epub3_with_ncx_only_config` function (lines approx 2430-2465). Ensure it's syntactically correct.
    2.  **Resume TDD for NCX-only**: Once the test file is clean, re-run `PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py::test_generate_epub3_with_ncx_only_config`. It should fail due to the SUT not yet correctly handling the `include_ncx: True` and `include_nav_doc: False` for EPUB3.
    3.  **SUT Implementation**: Modify `EpubGenerator.generate()` in `synth_data_gen/generators/epub.py` to correctly create only an NCX (and not a NAV document) when these flags are set for EPUB3.
    4.  **Verify Green**: Re-run the test to confirm it passes.
    5.  **Continue with other complex scenarios.**
- **Files Affected**: [`tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py:1).
### [2025-05-15 03:53:00] - TDD - Blocker &amp; Early Return: Complex Config Test - `TypeError` in OPF Generation
- **Trigger**: Persistent `TypeError: Argument must be bytes or unicode, got 'MagicMock'` when `lxml.etree.Element('package', package_attributes)` is called during `EpubBook._write_opf()`. This occurs in the new test `test_generate_epub_with_complex_config_and_interactions` even after attempting to correctly mock `EpubBook` and its methods. Context at 42%.
- **Blocker**: Inability to get the `test_generate_epub_with_complex_config_and_interactions` into a clean "Red" state (failing due to content assertion) because of the underlying `TypeError` during the `epub.write_epub` process (even when `epub.write_epub` itself is mocked, the error occurs if the `book` object's attributes are not perfectly aligned with `lxml` expectations for string/bytes types).
- **Progress Before Blocker**:
    - Successfully added and passed integration tests for notes content (`test_generate_epub_with_notes_content_is_correct`) and image content (`test_generate_epub_with_images_content_is_correct`), including SUT implementations in `EpubGenerator._add_notes_to_chapter` and `_add_images_to_chapter`.
    - Added the new complex test `test_generate_epub_with_complex_config_and_interactions` with a detailed configuration.
    - Attempted several strategies to mock `epub.EpubBook` and its methods/attributes to satisfy `epub.write_epub` and `lxml`.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker**:
    1.  Initial `MagicMock()` for `EpubBook`.
    2.  `MagicMock(spec=epub.EpubBook)`.
    3.  `MagicMock()` with pre-set attributes (`version`, `uid_name`, etc.) and `side_effect` for setter methods (`set_identifier`, `set_title`, `set_language`, `add_author`, `add_metadata`).
    4.  Mocking `epub.write_epub` itself to bypass `lxml` error, which allowed other assertions to run but doesn't fully test the OPF generation path if `epubcheck` were to run on a real file.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The interaction between `unittest.mock.MagicMock` and the `ebooklib` library's internal use of `lxml` for OPF generation is proving difficult to mock correctly when `epub.write_epub` is *not* mocked. `lxml` seems to require true string/bytes types for attributes it uses from the `book` object, and `MagicMock` attributes, even if set by side effects to strings, might still be perceived as `MagicMock` instances by `lxml`'s C-level code. The most recent test run (where `epub.write_epub` was *not* mocked) failed with this `TypeError`.
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: Multiple iterations of mocking `EpubBook` and its methods. Corrected indentation issues.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 42%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for SPARC/User/Debugger)**:
    1.  **Focus on SUT for OPF Data**: Instead of deeply mocking `EpubBook` for `write_epub` to pass, consider if the SUT (`EpubGenerator.generate`) correctly *calls* the `EpubBook` methods (`set_title`, `set_identifier`, `add_item`, `add_metadata`, `set_spine`, etc.) with the correct data. The `test_generate_epub_opf_contains_essential_metadata_and_manifest_items` was intended for this but needs refinement.
    2.  **Refine OPF Test**: The test `test_generate_epub_opf_contains_essential_metadata_and_manifest_items` should be the primary vehicle for testing if the `book` object is correctly prepared by the SUT *before* `write_epub` is called. This test should mock `epub.write_epub` and then inspect the state of the `mock_book_instance` (e.g., `mock_book_instance.title`, `mock_book_instance.uid`, contents of `mock_book_instance.metadata['DC']`, `mock_book_instance.items`, `mock_book_instance.spine`).
    3.  **Simplify Complex Test**: For `test_generate_epub_with_complex_config_and_interactions`, if the goal is to check content transformation and `epubcheck` call, continue mocking `epub.write_epub`. The `TypeError` from `lxml` is a distraction if `epub.write_epub` is not the SUT for that specific test's primary assertions. The content assertion (which is the true "Red" state for TDD of content generation) was: `AssertionError: Chapter content with images was expected to be '<h1>Chapter with Images</h1><p>Some text <img src="images/imgkey1.png" alt="Test Image 1" /> and more text.</p>', but was ''<h1>Chapter with Images</h1><p>Some text [image:imgkey1] and more text.</p>''` (from a previous run where `write_epub` was mocked). This indicates the SUT's processing methods in the `complex_create_chapter_content_side_effect` are not being called or are not effective.
    4.  **Delegate SUT work for Complex Test**: If the complex test is intended to make the SUT's `_create_chapter_content` (and its sub-calls like `_create_section_content`, `_apply_citations_to_item_content`, `_add_notes_to_chapter`, `_add_images_to_chapter`) work together on a piece of raw HTML, then the `complex_create_chapter_content_side_effect` in the test is bypassing the SUT's orchestration. The test should let the SUT's `_create_chapter_content` run (perhaps with minimal mocking of its deepest dependencies if they generate too much noise) and then assert the final content.
- **Files Affected**: [`tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py:1).
### [2025-05-15 03:00:00] - TDD - Persistent Unexpected Passing Test - `test_generate_epub_with_intext_citations_content`
- **Trigger**: Multiple attempts to create a failing test for citation content transformation have resulted in the test unexpectedly passing.
- **Context**:
    - SUT `_apply_citations_to_item_content` in [`synth_data_gen/generators/epub.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/epub.py:230) is confirmed to be a passthrough (returns `item_content` unmodified after adding the `return` statement).
    - SUT `_create_chapter_content` (with mocks for sub-elements like sections, notes, images to return 0 count) produces a predictable initial HTML (e.g., `<h1>Chapter 1</h1>`).
    - The test `test_generate_epub_with_intext_citations_content` in [`tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py:1) is set up to *not* mock `_apply_citations_to_item_content`.
    - The test asserts that the final chapter content is a *transformed* string (e.g., `<h1>Chapter 1 - (KrV, A 73 / B 98)</h1>`).
    - Expected behavior: `found_chapter.content` should be `<h1>Chapter 1</h1>`, and the assertion `assert "<h1>Chapter 1</h1>" == "<h1>Chapter 1 - (KrV, A 73 / B 98)</h1>"` should fail.
- **Problem**: The test consistently passes, implying the assertion is true, which contradicts the SUT's current logic.
- **Attempts**:
    - Verified SUT method `_apply_citations_to_item_content` is a passthrough.
    - Verified test does not mock `_apply_citations_to_item_content`'s transformational behavior.
    - Modified test assertions multiple times to ensure they should fail given the SUT state.
    - Confirmed file contents using `read_file`.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The persistent unexpected passing suggests a deeper issue:
    - Possible mismatch between the agent's understanding of file state on disk and actual state due to caching or sync issues with the execution environment.
    - A fundamental misunderstanding of `pytest-mock` behavior in this specific integration context, though standard mock behavior should lead to failure.
    - An unnoticed side effect from other parts of the test setup or other tests (less likely with pytest isolation).
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: Multiple revisions of test assertions and mock setups. Re-reading file contents.
- **Context %**: ~33%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps**:
    1.  **Drastic Simplification of Test**: Reduce `test_generate_epub_with_intext_citations_content` to the absolute bare minimum to force a controllable failure and regain understanding of the test-SUT interaction.
    2.  **Isolate `_apply_citations_to_item_content`**: If integration testing remains problematic, write a separate, focused unit test for `_apply_citations_to_item_content` to verify its transformation logic in isolation before re-attempting complex integration.
    3.  **Consider `new_task` for Debugging**: If basic forced failures cannot be achieved, delegate to `debug` mode with a very specific task to investigate why a simple assertion like `assert "A" == "B"` might appear to pass in this test's context, or why mocks are not behaving as documented.
- **Files Affected**: [`tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py:1), [`synth_data_gen/generators/epub.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/epub.py:1).
### [2025-05-15 02:15:00] - TDD - Early Return (High Context &amp; Tool Repetition Limit) - EpubGenerator Integration
- **Trigger**: Context size at 45% and `read_file` tool repetition limit reached during Memory Bank update. User explicitly requested Early Return.
- **Blocker**: Inability to complete Memory Bank update due to tool error, preventing further reliable operations. High context is a contributing factor.
- **Progress Before Early Return**:
    - Successfully initialized Memory Bank.
    - Added and passed integration tests for `EpubGenerator` verifying:
        - Correct ToC component calls for EPUB3 (NAV) and EPUB2 (NCX) defaults (`test_generate_epub_with_basic_config_integrates_toc`, `test_generate_epub2_with_basic_config_integrates_ncx`).
        - Correct ToC structure and `book.toc` population for EPUB3 NAV and EPUB2 NCX (`test_generate_epub3_navdoc_is_correctly_structured`, `test_generate_epub2_ncx_is_correctly_structured`). This involved several fixes to `EpubGenerator.generate()` and `toc.py` related to publisher metadata, `epub_version` handling, `book.lang` retrieval, and ensuring ToC items are correctly added and processed.
        - Placeholder method calls for citations (`_apply_citations_to_item_content`), notes (`_add_notes_to_chapter`), and multimedia images (`_add_images_to_chapter`).
        - Basic custom metadata integration (`test_generate_epub_with_custom_metadata`).
        - Basic font embedding integration (`test_generate_epub_with_font_embedding`).
    - Identified that the `test_generate_epub3_navdoc_respects_max_depth` was not effectively testing `max_depth` due to the current flat structure of `chapters_content` passed to ToC functions; this test needs future refactoring.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker (Memory Bank Update)**:
    - Attempted to update [`memory-bank/activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md:1) via `apply_diff`.
    - `apply_diff` failed due to content mismatch.
    - Attempted `read_file` on [`memory-bank/activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md:1) to get fresh content for `apply_diff`.
    - `read_file` failed with "Tool call repetition limit reached".
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The immediate blocker is the `read_file` repetition limit, preventing Memory Bank updates. The underlying cause might be a rapid succession of `apply_diff` and `read_file` calls due to minor discrepancies in the expected vs. actual content of Memory Bank files, exacerbated by the high context window.
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: Retrying `apply_diff` after `read_file` (which then failed).
- **Context % at Early Return**: 45%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for SPARC/User/Debugger)**:
    1.  **Delegate to New Instance**: Due to high context and tool errors, delegate the remainder of the "TDD for `EpubGenerator` Integration" task to a new `tdd` agent instance with a fresh context.
    2.  **Memory Bank Synchronization**: The new instance should carefully re-initialize its Memory Bank. If `read_file` issues persist for the new instance on Memory Bank files, it may indicate a deeper issue with the files or the tool, and `memory-bank-doctor` mode might be needed.
    3.  **Prioritize Remaining Tests**: The new instance should focus on:
        *   More complex configurations from [`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md:1).
        *   Verifying the *actual content and structure* generated by integrated components (not just mock calls), e.g., ensuring citations appear correctly, notes are formatted, images are embedded.
        *   Testing interactions between multiple components (e.g., notes within sections that also have citations).
        *   Ensuring generated EPUB files are valid (this might require a new testing strategy or tool).
        *   Revisiting the `test_generate_epub3_navdoc_respects_max_depth` once the data flow for ToC generation supports nested structures properly.
- **Files Affected in this session (committed/uncommitted)**:
    - [`tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py:1) (multiple new tests added and passed)
    - [`synth_data_gen/generators/epub.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/epub.py:1) (fixes for publisher metadata, `epub_version` string, custom metadata processing, font name basename)
    - [`synth_data_gen/generators/epub_components/toc.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/epub_components/toc.py:1) (fixes for `epub_version` check, `book.lang` retrieval, `EpubHtml` attribute access, adding NCX item to book)
    - Memory Bank files (partially updated, some updates failed).
### [2025-05-14 13:41:00] - TDD - Early Return (High Context &amp; Persistent Metadata Test Failure) - `structure.py` Calibre Artifacts
- **Trigger**: Context size at 42% and persistent failures (3+ attempts) in `test_create_epub_structure_calibre_artifacts_content` and `test_create_epub_structure_calibre_artifacts_creates_file` for [`synth_data_gen/generators/epub_components/structure.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/epub_components/structure.py:1).
- **Context**:
    - Attempted to add Calibre-specific metadata (e.g., `calibre:series`) using `book.add_metadata('OPF', 'meta', None, {'name': 'calibre:series', ...})` and `book.add_metadata(None, 'meta', None, {'name': 'calibre:series', ...})`.
    - Tests in [`tests/generators/epub_components/test_structure.py`](tests/generators/epub_components/test_structure.py:1) were adjusted to iterate through `book.metadata.get('OPF', [])` and `book.metadata.get(None, [])` respectively.
- **Problem**:
    - Tests consistently fail to find the `calibre:series` metadata.
    - The content test (`test_create_epub_structure_calibre_artifacts_content`) also intermittently shows `ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3)` when iterating `book.metadata.get(None, [])`, despite attempts to make the tuple unpacking more robust. This suggests inconsistencies in how `ebooklib` stores metadata tuples when the primary text content of a tag is `None` or empty.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The primary blocker is an inability to reliably add and then retrieve custom `meta` tags (like those used by Calibre) using `ebooklib`'s `add_metadata` and `get_metadata` (or direct iteration of `book.metadata`) in a way that is consistently verifiable by the tests. The exact storage mechanism or retrieval path for these specific `meta name="..." content="..."` tags, especially when the tag's direct text value is `None` or `''`, is proving elusive.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 42%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for SPARC/User/Debugger)**:
    1.  **Delegate to Debug**: Create a new task for `debug` mode to:
        *   Investigate precisely how `ebooklib.epub.EpubBook.add_metadata(namespace, 'meta', value, {'name': 'X', 'content': 'Y'})` stores this information within the `book.metadata` structure, particularly when `namespace` is `None` or `'OPF'`, and `value` is `None` or `''`.
        *   Determine the correct and most robust way to iterate through `book.metadata` (for both `None` and `'OPF'` namespaces) to find a `meta` tag by its `name` attribute (e.g., `calibre:series`) and retrieve its `content` attribute.
        *   Provide a clear example of how to correctly add AND then correctly retrieve such a `meta` tag's `content` attribute for testing purposes.
    2.  **Simplify SUT & Test**: The debugger should work with a minimal version of `create_epub_structure_calibre_artifacts` (adding only *one* Calibre meta tag) and the corresponding simplified test in `test_structure.py` to isolate the problem.
    3.  **Consider `write_epub` then `read_epub`**: For the `_creates_file` test, if direct inspection of the `book` object (when `write_file=False`) is problematic, an alternative is to write the EPUB to a temporary file and then use `epub.read_epub()` and inspect the `opf` content directly as XML if `get_metadata` continues to be unreliable for these specific tags.
- **Files Affected**: [`synth_data_gen/generators/epub_components/structure.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/epub_components/structure.py:1), [`tests/generators/epub_components/test_structure.py`](tests/generators/epub_components/test_structure.py:1), [`memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md`](memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md:1).
### [2025-05-14 12:50:00] - TDD - Early Return (High Context &amp; apply_diff Failure) - `structure.py`
- **Trigger**: Context size at 50% and `apply_diff` failure due
### [2025-05-14 00:48:00] - TDD - Early Return (High Context &amp; Persistent EPUB Error) - `create_epub_kant_style_footnotes`
- **Trigger**: User feedback to "return early" and context size at 45%. Persistent failure in `test_create_epub_kant_style_footnotes_content`.
- **Context**:
    - Added tests for `create_epub_kant_style_footnotes` in `tests/generators/epub_components/test_notes.py`.
    - Multiple attempts to modify `synth_data_gen/generators/epub_components/notes.py::create_epub_kant_style_footnotes` to resolve EPUB generation errors.
- **Problem**: Tests consistently fail with `ebooklib.epub.EpubException: 'Can not find container file'`, preceded by `TypeError: Argument must be bytes or unicode, got 'NoneType'` originating from `synth_data_gen/common/utils.py::_write_epub_file` during the `epub.write_epub()` call.
- **Analysis of Blocker**:
    - The `TypeError` suggests that `epub.write_epub` is encountering a `None` value where it expects string or bytes. This leads to an invalid or incomplete EPUB structure, causing the subsequent "Can not find container file" when `epub.read_epub` tries to parse it.
    - Attempts to resolve this included:
        - Ensuring correct CSS linking within chapter HTML and via `chapter.add_item()`.
        - Verifying items are added to `book.items` correctly using `book.add_item()` and not causing duplicates.
        - Temporarily simplifying the EPUB structure (removing ToC, NCX, Nav, simplifying chapter content).
        - Refactoring the SUT to use the `_add_epub_chapters` helper.
        - Removing redundant CSS links from chapter content when `_add_epub_chapters` handles it.
    - Despite these changes, the core `TypeError` within `epub.write_epub` persists, indicating a fundamental issue with how `ebooklib` is processing the `book` object for this specific function, even when other similar functions in the same file work correctly.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 45%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for SPARC/User/Debugger)**:
    1.  **Delegate to Debug**: Create a new task for `debug` mode to specifically investigate the `TypeError: Argument must be bytes or unicode, got 'NoneType'` within `synth_data_gen/common/utils.py::_write_epub_file` when called by `synth_data_gen/generators/epub_components/notes.py::create_epub_kant_style_footnotes`. The debugger should focus on what part of the `book` object (metadata, items, spine, content of items) is causing `epub.write_epub` to encounter `None`.
    2.  **Isolate `_write_epub_file` Call**: The debugger might need to insert print statements or use a debugger directly within `_write_epub_file` to inspect the `book` object just before `epub.write_epub` is called by this specific SUT.
    3.  **Compare with Working Functions**: Compare the structure and content of the `book` object generated by `create_epub_kant_style_footnotes` with one from a known working function in `notes.py` (e.g., `create_epub_hegel_sol_style_footnotes`) just before `_write_epub_file` is called.
- **Files Affected**: `synth_data_gen/generators/epub_components/notes.py`, `tests/generators/epub_components/test_notes.py`, `memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md`.
### [2025-05-11 23:47:00] - TDD - Early Return (User Request &amp; High Context) - Test Failures in MarkdownGenerator
- **Trigger**: User request for Early Return to migrate tests to `pytest`. Context size at 56%.
- **Context**:
    - Indentation issues in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` were addressed using `write_to_file`. Tests are now discovered (24 tests).
    - Stub methods (`_create_md_...`) were added to `synth_data_gen/generators/markdown.py`.
    - `apply_diff` was used to correct `side_effect` signature in `test_generate_range_headings_count`.
- **Problem**: Running `python3 -m unittest tests.generators.test_markdown_generator` results in 13 FAILED tests (8 ERRORS, 5 FAILURES).
    - **ERRORS (8)**: Primarily `TypeError` in `side_effect` functions within various tests (e.g., `test_generate_exact_code_blocks_count.<locals>.side_effect() missing 1 required positional argument: 'key'`). This indicates incorrect mock `side_effect` signatures.
    - **FAILURES (5)**:
        - `test_generate_frontmatter_json_basic`: `AssertionError: False is not true : Content should be a JSON object if style is JSON`.
        - `test_generate_frontmatter_yaml_not_included_when_chance_is_zero`: `AssertionError: Expected '_generate_frontmatter' to not have been called. Called 1 times.`
        - Other `AssertionError`s related to `mock_determine_count.call_args_list` mismatches and `mock_create_heading.call_count` being 0 instead of 3 in `test_generate_range_headings_count`.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The immediate blockers are the incorrect `side_effect` signatures in multiple tests and the logic errors in frontmatter generation/testing. The high number of inter-related failures makes iterative TDD cycles slow.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 56%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for SPARC/User)**:
    1.  **New Task for Pytest Migration**: As per user request, create a new task for `devops` or `code` mode to:
        *   Install `pytest` and `pytest-cov`.
        *   Migrate all tests in the `tests/` directory from `unittest` to `pytest` style. This includes updating assertions, class structures, and mock usage as needed.
        *   Ensure all tests pass after migration or document any new failures introduced by the migration itself.
    2.  **Address Test Failures (Post-Migration)**: Once migrated to `pytest` (which might offer better debugging), create a new `tdd` or `debug` task to address the underlying logic errors highlighted by the current failures in `test_markdown_generator.py`.
- **Files Affected**: `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`, `synth_data_gen/generators/markdown.py`, `memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md`.
### [2025-05-11 23:27:40] - TDD - User Intervention: Re-check Indentation for Test Discovery
- **Trigger**: User feedback after `attempt_completion` (Early Return).
- **Context**: Agent invoked Early Return due to persistent `AttributeError` when trying to run new frontmatter tests in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`, believing the issue was beyond simple indentation.
- **User Guidance**: User stated the problem is "just the indentation" and advised to "read 1111-end" of `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`.
- **Action**: Will re-read lines 1111 to the end of `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` to meticulously check the indentation of `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` and `test_generate_frontmatter_json_basic` methods relative to the class structure.
- **Rationale**: User's strong assertion suggests a specific indentation error might have been missed or misinterpreted by the agent.
- **Outcome**: If a clear indentation error is found, it will be corrected. If not, the underlying discovery issue might still persist.
- **Follow-up**: Re-read specified file section, apply diff if necessary, then re-run tests.
### [2025-05-11 23:25:00] - TDD - CRITICAL Blocker & Early Return: Persistent Test Discovery Failure (Post-Indentation Fix)
- **Trigger**: After committing indentation fixes, `python3 -m unittest -v tests.generators.test_markdown_generator.TestMarkdownGenerator.test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` still fails with `AttributeError: type object 'TestMarkdownGenerator' has no attribute 'test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic'`.
- **Context**:
    - Indentation and minor cleanup changes were applied to `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` and committed.
    - Full regression suite (`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"`) passed, finding 14 tests.
    - Running `python3 -m unittest tests.generators.test_markdown_generator` still only discovers 5 tests.
- **Problem**: The `unittest` framework is consistently unable to discover or execute newly added test methods (`test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic`, `test_generate_frontmatter_json_basic`) in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`, even when targeted directly. This issue persists despite code corrections.
- **Critical Evaluation**: The issue is not a simple syntax or indentation error that can be fixed with `apply_diff` or `write_to_file`. It's a deeper test discovery/execution anomaly specific to this file or environment.
- **Attempts**: Previous sessions involved numerous attempts (see entry `[2025-05-11 23:00:00]`). Current session confirmed the issue persists after targeted fixes and commit.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: Root cause remains unknown. Potential causes: `unittest` caching, subtle environment/Python path issues, non-obvious character/encoding problems in the file not visible in `read_file`, or a deeper conflict within the `unittest` framework's interaction with this file.
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: Indentation correction, direct test execution.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 16%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for SPARC/User/Debugger)**:
    1.  **Manual Deep Dive**: A developer needs to manually open `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` in an IDE, ensure no hidden characters or encoding issues exist.
    2.  **Simplify Radically**: Create a *minimal* copy of `TestMarkdownGenerator` with only `setUp`, `tearDown`, and *one* of the problematic tests (e.g., `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic`). See if this minimal version runs. If it does, incrementally add back other tests to find a conflict. If it doesn't, the issue is very fundamental.
    3.  **Python Environment Check**: Verify Python environment, `sys.path`, and any `PYTHONPATH` variables. Clear `__pycache__` directories (`find . -path "*/__pycache__/*" -delete` and `find . -name "*.pyc" -delete`).
    4.  **Delegate to Debug**: If the issue persists after manual checks, delegate to `debug` mode for a focused investigation on Python's `unittest` discovery and execution behavior in this specific file and environment.
    5.  **Alternative Test Runner**: Consider if `pytest` (mentioned in global context as a future enhancement) might behave differently and if a temporary switch for this file is feasible for debugging discovery.
- **Files Affected**: `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` (committed), `memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md`.
### [2025-05-11 23:00:00] - TDD - CRITICAL Blocker & Early Return: Persistent Test Discovery Failure
- **Trigger**: Multiple failed attempts to get new tests (`test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic`, `test_generate_frontmatter_json_basic`) in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` to be discovered and fail as expected. Context at 41%.
- **Context**:
    - User feedback confirmed file length and test presence.
    - Duplicate TOML test method was removed.
    - Indentation of remaining TOML and new JSON test methods verified and corrected.
    - Assertions for TOML and JSON tests were made more stringent to ensure failure if SUT produces YAML.
- **Problem**:
    - Running `unittest discover tests/generators/` consistently reports "Ran 49 tests ... OK", indicating the new tests are either not being run or are incorrectly passing.
    - Running tests individually or by class (`TestMarkdownGenerator`) previously resulted in `AttributeError: type object 'TestMarkdownGenerator' has no attribute 'test_name'` or only ran the original 5 tests in that file.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Previous assumptions that this was a simple indentation or file content issue were incorrect. The problem is a persistent test discovery/execution anomaly with `unittest` in this environment for newly added methods in this specific file, despite them appearing structurally correct.
- **Attempts**: Numerous `read_file`, `apply_diff`, `insert_content`, `write_to_file`, and various `execute_command` for `unittest` (direct, class, discover with/without patterns).
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The root cause of `unittest`'s failure to discover/run these specific new tests correctly is unknown and beyond the capability to diagnose with current tools and TDD scope. It might be Python/unittest caching, a subtle environment issue, or a non-obvious conflict.
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: Varied test execution commands, file content normalization, indentation correction, assertion strengthening.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 41%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for SPARC/User/Debugger)**:
    1.  **Manual Investigation**: Manually run `python3 -m unittest -v tests.generators.test_markdown_generator.TestMarkdownGenerator.test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` (and for JSON) in a fresh terminal. Check for any environment variables or `__pycache__` issues that might interfere.
    2.  **Simplify Further**: Temporarily comment out *all other tests* in `test_markdown_generator.py` except for `setUp`, `tearDown`, and the `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` to see if it gets discovered and runs in isolation.
    3.  **Delegate to Debug**: If the issue persists, delegate to `debug` mode for a focused investigation on Python's `unittest` discovery and execution behavior in this specific file and environment.
    4.  **Alternative Test Runner**: Consider if `pytest` (mentioned in global context as a future enhancement) might behave differently and if a temporary switch for this file is feasible for debugging discovery.
- **Files Affected**: `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`, `memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md`.
### [2025-05-11 22:59:00] - TDD - User Intervention: Indentation of New Frontmatter Tests
- **Trigger**: User feedback after task interruption and previous `apply_diff`.
- **Context**: Agent had removed a duplicate `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` and was about to run tests. User indicated that the remaining TOML and the new JSON test methods might still have incorrect indentation, preventing discovery.
- **Action**: Acknowledged. Will re-read the file sections for both `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` and `test_generate_frontmatter_json_basic` to verify and correct indentation if necessary.
- **Rationale**: User's guidance suggests that previous file operations might not have left both methods correctly indented for `unittest` discovery.
- **Outcome**: Will ensure both test methods are correctly structured before attempting to run them.
- **Follow-up**: Re-read relevant sections of `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` and apply diffs if needed.
### [2025-05-11 22:57:00] - TDD - User Intervention: Test Method Location Clarification
- **Trigger**: User feedback after `ask_followup_question` regarding test discovery.
- **Context**: Agent was struggling with `AttributeError` and `unittest` not discovering newly added frontmatter tests (`toml`, `json`) in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`. Agent suspected file corruption or complex discovery issues.
- **User Guidance**: User indicated the tests are present in the file within lines 1111-1189.
- **Action**: Acknowledged error in understanding file state/line numbers after previous operations. Will re-read the specified section to get an accurate view.
- **Rationale**: User's direct pointer to the lines suggests the methods exist in the file, and the problem might be more nuanced than simple absence or gross misplacement.
- **Outcome**: Will help re-evaluate the test discovery problem with accurate file context.
- **Follow-up**: Re-read `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` lines 1111-1189.
### [2025-05-11 22:45:00] - TDD - Blocker: Test Discovery Failure for `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic`
- **Trigger**: Persistent `AttributeError` and 0 tests found by `discover` when targeting `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic`.
- **Context**: After multiple attempts to add and correct the `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` method in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` (including `insert_content`, `apply_diff` for indentation, and `write_to_file` to ensure clean content), the `unittest` framework consistently fails to discover this specific test method. Running the test directly results in `AttributeError: type object 'TestMarkdownGenerator' has no attribute 'test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic'`. Running `unittest discover -p '*toml_basic.py' -s tests/generators/` (note: pattern should have been for the method, not file) also found 0 tests. Running the entire class `TestMarkdownGenerator` only finds the original 5 tests.
- **Analysis**: The cause is unclear. File content and structure appear correct. This might be an obscure issue with the test runner's discovery mechanism in this environment, a non-visible character, or a subtle naming conflict not immediately apparent.
- **Action**: Will attempt to add the *next* planned test (for JSON frontmatter) to see if the discovery issue is specific to the TOML test or affects any new test added to this file.
- **Follow-up**: If the JSON test is also undiscoverable, this points to a more significant problem with the test file or environment.
### [2025-05-11 22:43:00] - TDD - User Intervention: Incorrect File Length Assumption
- **Trigger**: User feedback after `ask_followup_question`.
- **Context**: Multiple attempts to add `test_generate_frontmatter_toml_basic` to `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` failed with `AttributeError` (test not found). This was due to misinterpreting truncated `read_file` outputs and assuming a file length (around 1254 lines) that was much longer than the actual file length (1153 lines). Operations were targeted at non-existent lines or outside the class structure.
- **Action**: Acknowledged error. Will re-read the file to ascertain correct structure and insertion points.
- **Rationale**: User correctly identified that the agent was operating with an incorrect understanding of the file's true length.
- **Outcome**: Prevents further erroneous file operations.
- **Follow-up**: Re-read `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` to determine the correct insertion point for the new test method.
### [2025-05-11 22:05:39] - TDD - Early Return Invoked (Context Size)
- **Trigger**: Context size reached 42%, approaching the 40-50% threshold for proactive Early Return.
- **Blocker**: No specific code blocker. Early return is due to context window management.
- **Progress Before Early Return**:
    - **`PdfGenerator`**:
        - Completed TDD cycles for `page_count_config` (probabilistic).
        - Implemented and tested routing based on `layout.columns`.
        - Verified `running_header.enable` functionality (existing code was correct).
        - Implemented and tested `visual_toc.enable` routing and fallback.
        - Implemented and tested `pdf_tables_occurrence_config` (exact count) within the `single_column_text` variant.
        - Implemented and tested `pdf_figures_occurrence_config` (exact count) within the `single_column_text` variant.
    - **`MarkdownGenerator`**:
        - Created test file `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`.
        - Corrected `get_default_specific_config` to align with Unified Quantity Specification for several fields.
        - Implemented and tested `headings_config.count` (exact) in `_create_md_basic_elements_content`.
        - Implemented and tested `md_list_items_config.count` (exact) in `_create_md_basic_elements_content`.
        - Implemented and tested `md_images_config.count` (exact) in `_create_md_basic_elements_content`.
        - Implemented and tested `gfm_features.md_tables_occurrence_config.count` (exact) in `_create_md_extended_elements_content`.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker**: N/A.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: N/A.
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: N/A.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 42%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps (for new TDD agent instance)**:
    1.  **Continue `MarkdownGenerator` `generate()` Tests**:
        *   Implement range and probabilistic tests for `headings_config`, `md_list_items_config`, `md_images_config`.
        *   Test other GFM features: `md_footnotes_occurrence_config`, `md_task_lists_occurrence_config`, `md_code_blocks_config` (exact, range, probabilistic for each).
        *   Test `frontmatter` settings (all styles: yaml, toml, json; various field combinations).
    2.  **Continue `PdfGenerator` `generate()` Tests**:
        *   Test remaining `pdf_specific_settings` like `running_header` content variations, `visual_toc` depth, and more detailed `table_generation` and `figure_generation` parameters (e.g., specific table content, figure captions, different occurrence types).
    3.  **Begin `EpubGenerator` `generate()` Tests**:
        *   Start with basic configuration and gradually add tests for `epub_specific_settings` (e.g., `sections_per_chapter_config`, `notes_config`, `images_config`, etc.), ensuring "Unified Quantity Specification" is covered.
        *   Test styling and feature flags (ToC styles, note types, page numbering, multimedia).
    4.  **Systematic `epub_components` Unit Tests**:
        *   Create test files in `tests/generators/epub_components/` if they don't exist for each module in `synth_data_gen/generators/epub_components/`.
        *   Write detailed unit tests for public functions/classes within each component (e.g., `citations.py`, `content_types.py`, etc.). Expand tests for `toc.py`.
    5.  **Refine `EpubGenerator` Integration**: Iteratively refactor `EpubGenerator.generate()` to use the `epub_components` as their tests are developed.
    6.  **`ConfigLoader` Implementation and Testing**: Implement and test the full `ConfigLoader` class.
    7.  **Git**: Ensure all new/modified test and source code files are committed to Git in logical chunks. The last commit by this agent will include changes up to the GFM tables test for MarkdownGenerator.
    8.  **Memory Bank**: Continue to update Memory Bank files as per TDD rules.

### [2025-05-11 21:41:29] - TDD - Early Return Invoked
- **Trigger**: User instruction to "probably early return" and context size at 47%.
- **Blocker**: The test `test_generate_single_column_page_count_range` in `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py` is failing with `TypeError: BaseGenerator._determine_count() missing 1 required positional argument: 'context_key_name'`. This occurred after attempting to use a `side_effect` to wrap the original `_determine_count` method to resolve a previous `TypeError` with `@patch.object(PdfGenerator, '_determine_count', wraps=PdfGenerator._determine_count)`. The current mocking strategy for spying on `_determine_count` while also controlling the behavior of `random.randint` within it is problematic.
- **Progress Before Blocker**:
    - Successfully added and passed tests for `chapters_config` (exact, range, probabilistic) in `PdfGenerator`.
    - Successfully added and passed test for `page_count_config` (exact integer) in `PdfGenerator`.
    - Added test for `page_count_config` (range) in `PdfGenerator` which is currently failing.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker**:
    - Initial attempt used `@patch.object(PdfGenerator, '_determine_count', wraps=PdfGenerator._determine_count)` which led to a `TypeError`.
    - Current attempt uses `@patch.object(PdfGenerator, '_determine_count')` and sets `side_effect` to a function that calls `BaseGenerator._determine_count(self.generator, ...)`. This also results in a `TypeError` indicating `context_key_name` is missing.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The interaction between mocking `PdfGenerator._determine_count` (to assert it's called with specific parameters like "page_count") and also needing `BaseGenerator._determine_count` to execute its internal logic (which calls the patched `random.randint`) is complex. The `wraps` argument and the manual `side_effect` approach have both led to TypeErrors related to argument passing to the wrapped/original method.
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: Switched from `wraps` to a manual `side_effect` to call the original method. Added import for `BaseGenerator`.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 47%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps**:
    1.  **Delegate Task**: Create a new task for a fresh `tdd` instance (or `debug` mode) to specifically fix the `test_generate_single_column_page_count_range` method in `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`.
    2.  **Targeted Fix**: The fix should focus on ensuring that `_determine_count` is called correctly with `page_count_range_config` and `"page_count"`, and that `random.randint` (mocked as `mock_base_randint`) is called with `page_count_range_config["min"]` and `page_count_range_config["max"]`. This might involve:
        *   Revisiting the mocking strategy for `_determine_count`. Perhaps only patch `synth_data_gen.core.base.random.randint` and then assert the calls to the *actual* `self.generator._determine_count` if the goal is to ensure it's called with the right high-level config, and separately trust `BaseGenerator._determine_count` to use `randint` correctly (as it's tested elsewhere).
        *   Alternatively, if spying on the call to `PdfGenerator._determine_count` is essential, ensure the `side_effect` or `wraps` correctly passes all arguments.
    3.  **Provide Exact Context**: The new task should be provided with the current content of `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py` and `synth_data_gen/core/base.py`.
    4.  **Resume TDD**: Once this specific test is fixed and passing, TDD can resume with the probabilistic case for `PdfGenerator.page_count_config`.
[2025-05-11 21:18:00] - TDD - Early Return Follow-up - Resolved
- **Trigger**: Current task completion.
- **Context**: This entry follows up on the Early Return documented at "[2025-05-11 14:21:00] - TDD - Early Return Invoked".
- **Action**: The specific task to refactor `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` in `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py` was successfully completed.
- **Rationale**: The refactoring addressed the incorrect mocking strategy and persistent `apply_diff` failures by:
    1. Correctly structuring the `specific_config`, `global_config`, and `output_path` for the `generate()` call.
    2. Temporarily removing the instance-level `_determine_count` mock to allow the `BaseGenerator`'s method (which uses the patched `random.randint`) to be called.
    3. Simplifying the `finally` block to robustly restore the mock. This required switching from `apply_diff` / `search_and_replace` to `write_to_file` due to persistent tool matching issues with the `finally` block's structure.
- **Outcome**: `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` now passes. All tests in `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py` pass. Changes committed (60f9ddd). The blocker from the previous session is resolved.
- **Follow-up**: None required for this specific issue.
[2025-05-11 21:10:47] - TDD - Task Completion - Successfully fixed `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` in `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`.
    - Trigger: User task to fix specific failing test method.
    - Context: Previous Early Return due to `apply_diff` issues.
    - Action:
        1. Read file `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py` to get current content for the method.
        2. Applied `apply_diff` to correct mocking logic and remove outdated comments in `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range`.
        3. Ran the specific test: `python3 -m unittest tests.generators.test_pdf_generator.TestPdfGenerator.test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` - PASSED.
        4. Ran all tests in the file: `python3 -m unittest tests.generators.test_pdf_generator.TestPdfGenerator` - PASSED (10 tests).
        5. Committed changes: `git add tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py && git commit -m "fix(tests): Correct mocking for chapters_config range test in PdfGenerator"` (commit `885780d`).
    - Rationale: Followed user instructions and TDD feedback log to resolve the test failure.
    - Outcome: Test fixed, all related tests pass, changes committed.
    - Follow-up: Task complete.
# TDD Feedback
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->
### [2025-05-11 14:21:00] - TDD - Early Return Invoked
- **Trigger**: Repeated `apply_diff` failures and high context usage (48%).
- **Blocker**: Persistent failures using the `apply_diff` tool to modify the `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` method in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1). The root cause of these failures was not consistently re-reading the file with `read_file` immediately before constructing the `SEARCH` block for `apply_diff`, especially after interruptions or previous `apply_diff` issues. This led to `SEARCH` blocks not matching the actual file content.
- **Progress Before Blocker**:
    - Successfully added and ran three new tests for `EpubGenerator` (`test_generate_unified_quantity_chapters_exact`, `_range`, `_probabilistic`) in [`tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py:1). These tests passed without new code, confirming existing robustness for `chapters_config`.
    - Added `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_exact` to [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1).
    - Implemented `_determine_count` in [`synth_data_gen/core/base.py`](synth_data_gen/core/base.py:1).
    - Added placeholder `_add_pdf_chapter_content` to [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:1) and refactored `_create_pdf_text_single_column` to use it. The `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_exact` for PDF now passes.
    - Corrected `AttributeError: module 'unittest' has no attribute 'mock'` in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1) by fixing imports.
- **Attempts on Current Blocker**: Multiple `apply_diff` attempts were made to refactor the mocking strategy in `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range`. Each failed due to `SEARCH` block mismatches, stemming from not using fresh file reads.
- **Analysis of Blocker**: The primary issue is a procedural error: failing to obtain the exact current file content for the `SEARCH` block of `apply_diff` immediately before its use. High context (48%) may also be contributing to difficulty in accurately constructing complex diffs.
- **Self-Correction Attempted**: The last attempt involved re-reading the file section, but the subsequent `apply_diff` was still formulated incorrectly or against a slightly diverged mental model of the file state.
- **Context % at Early Return**: 48%
- **Recommendations for Next Steps**:
    1.  **Delegate Task**: Create a new task for a fresh `tdd` instance (or `code` mode) with a clear context to specifically fix the `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` method in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1).
    2.  **Targeted Fix**: The fix should focus on:
        *   Removing the `@patch.object(PdfGenerator, '_determine_count')` decorator.
        *   Ensuring `@patch('synth_data_gen.core.base.random.randint')` is used, and the mock argument (`mock_base_randint`) is correctly passed and used.
        *   Removing any `mock_determine_count` parameter from the method signature and any related lines like `mock_determine_count.side_effect = None`.
        *   Removing the assertion `self.assertIn(call(chapters_range_config, "chapters"), mock_determine_count.call_args_list)`.
        *   Ensuring `mock_base_randint.assert_called_once_with(chapters_range_config["min"], chapters_range_config["max"])` is correctly implemented.
    3.  **Provide Exact Context**: The new task should be provided with the exact current content of the `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` method (and its decorators) from [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:180-230) (lines 180-230 based on the last `read_file` output) to serve as an accurate `SEARCH` block.
    4.  **Resume TDD**: Once this specific test is fixed and passing, TDD can resume with the probabilistic case for `PdfGenerator.chapters_config`, then move to `MarkdownGenerator`, and other objectives.
