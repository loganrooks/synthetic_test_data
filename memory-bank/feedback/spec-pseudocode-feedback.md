# Spec-Pseudocode Feedback
### [2025-05-11 04:06:11] - User Feedback on `attempt_completion` Message Content
- **Trigger:** User denied `new_task` tool use, clarifying previous feedback.
- **Context:** After successfully revising the specification document, I attempted to create a new task for SPARC to update its context.
- **User Feedback Summary:** The user clarified that the instruction for SPARC to update its context should be part of the `attempt_completion` message itself, not a separate `new_task`.
- **Action by User:** Denied `new_task`.
- **Rationale for Feedback:** The `attempt_completion` message should be comprehensive and include all necessary concluding information and directives.
- **Outcome/Impact:** The `attempt_completion` message needs to be reformulated.
- **Follow-up Action (by AI):**
    1. Log this feedback.
    2. Reformulate the `attempt_completion` message to include a clear directive for the Orchestrator (SPARC) to review the updated specification and related architectural/memory bank files.
### [2025-05-11 04:03:07] - User Feedback on Specification Extensibility
- **Trigger:** User provided feedback after approving the `write_to_file` operation for the revised specification.
- **Context:** The specification ([`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md)) was just updated to prioritize deterministic defaults.
- **User Feedback Summary:** The user emphasized that the system (as defined by the specification) must be easily extendable to include new kinds of formatting for features like Table of Contents, footnotes/endnotes, etc.
- **Action by User:** Provided feedback.
- **Rationale for Feedback:** Ensuring the system is designed for future extensibility of formatting options is a key requirement.
- **Outcome/Impact:** The specification already includes a plugin architecture for new generators (Section 4). For extending formatting options within existing generators (e.g., new ToC styles in `EpubGenerator`), the current specification allows this by defining string enum parameters (e.g., `toc_settings.style`). Adding a new style would involve:
    1. Defining the new style string in the specification's schema description for that parameter.
    2. The `code` mode implementing the logic for this new style string within the relevant generator's Python code.
    The specification itself supports this; the ease of *code-level* implementation of new styles is a concern for the `code` mode.
- **Follow-up Action (by AI):**
    1. Log this feedback.
    2. Ensure the `attempt_completion` message acknowledges that the specification supports this type of extensibility through its configurable string parameters, and that the implementation details fall to the `code` mode.
### [2025-05-11 03:49:04] - User Feedback on Specification Revision Attempt (Incomplete File Content)
- **Trigger:** User denied `write_to_file` operation.
- **Context:** Attempting to revise [`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md) to address previous feedback about deterministic defaults for "Unified Quantity Specification".
- **User Feedback Summary:** User was extremely dissatisfied because the `write_to_file` attempt included placeholders like "(Content remains the same)" instead of the full, explicit content for those sections. This is a critical error as it would lead to data loss and does not adhere to tool usage rules.
- **Action by User:** Denied operation.
- **Rationale for Feedback:** The `write_to_file` tool requires the *complete* intended content of the file. Using placeholders is unacceptable and leads to an incomplete and incorrect file.
- **Outcome/Impact:** The specification file was not correctly updated. A new attempt must be made with the full, corrected content.
- **Follow-up Action (by AI):**
    1. Log this critical feedback.
    2. Re-read the last known correct version of [`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md) (from before the failed `write_to_file` attempts) to ensure a proper base.
    3. Meticulously re-apply all intended changes:
        a. Incorporate the "Unified Quantity Specification" for all relevant parameters.
        b. Critically re-evaluate and adjust the default values for all `_config` parameters to prioritize deterministic (exact integer) counts, especially in Section 5 ("Default Data Set & 'Out-of-the-Box' Behavior").
        c. Ensure YAML examples clearly demonstrate exact integer usage.
        d. Ensure the introductory note about "Unified Quantity Specification" emphasizes the exact integer as a primary method.
    4. Construct the *entire and complete* content for the revised specification.
    5. Use `write_to_file` with the full, complete, and corrected content.
### [2025-05-11 03:45:19] - User Feedback on Specification Revision (Unified Quantity Specification)
- **Trigger:** User denied `attempt_completion` for the revised Synthetic Data Package Specification.
- **Context:** The revised specification ([`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md)) was intended to fully incorporate the "Unified Quantity Specification" to allow deterministic, ranged, or probabilistic counts.
- **User Feedback Summary:** User stated the revised specification's default values for quantity parameters (e.g., in the "Default Data Set" section) still heavily favored probabilistic or ranged approaches, rather than making deterministic (exact integer) counts the clear default or primary option for testability. This was perceived as not aligning with the architectural intent of enabling precise control for testing.
- **Action by User:** Denied completion. Questioned alignment with architectural overview and if an early return to architect mode was needed.
- **Rationale for Feedback:** The core reason for the "Unified Quantity Specification" was to improve testability by allowing precise, deterministic control over generated element quantities. If defaults and examples don't emphasize this, the benefit is lost.
- **Outcome/Impact:** The specification needs further revision to adjust default values for `_config` parameters to be deterministic (exact integers) where appropriate, especially in the default "out-of-the-box" configuration. Examples should also clearly showcase the deterministic integer usage as a primary method.
- **Follow-up Action (by AI):**
    1. Log this feedback.
    2. Re-read the specification file ([`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md)).
    3. Critically re-evaluate and adjust the default values for all `_config` parameters, particularly in Section 5 ("Default Data Set & 'Out-of-the-Box' Behavior"), to prioritize deterministic (exact integer) counts.
    4. Ensure YAML examples throughout the document clearly demonstrate the exact integer usage for `_config` parameters as a primary option.
    5. Re-submit the revised specification.

### [2025-05-11 02:23:31] - User Feedback on Specification (Early Return Invoked)
- **Trigger:** User denied `attempt_completion` for the Synthetic Data Package Specification.
- **Context:** The drafted specification ([`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md)) included probabilistic generation for elements like footnotes (e.g., `note_occurrence_chance`).
- **User Feedback Summary:** The user indicated that relying solely on probability for the number of elements (footnotes, images, etc.) is insufficient. For unit testing, the ability to specify the *precise number* of such elements is crucial to craft proper assertion statements. Probabilistic generation is acceptable as an option, but deterministic control is a primary requirement for testability.
- **Action by User:** Denied completion and suggested an early return, delegating to the `architect` mode to devise a better high-level plan/architecture that allows for precise control over element counts, which can then be used to revise the specifications.
- **Rationale for Feedback:** Probabilistic generation makes it difficult to write reliable and deterministic unit tests, as the exact output structure (e.g., number of notes) cannot be guaranteed.
- **Outcome/Impact:** The current specification needs revision to incorporate mechanisms for deterministic control over the quantity of generated sub-elements within synthetic files. The existing probabilistic approach can be a secondary option.
- **Follow-up Action (by AI):**
    1. Log this feedback.
    2. Invoke Early Return as per user instruction and error handling protocol.
    3. Recommend delegation to `architect` mode to address the design issue concerning deterministic vs. probabilistic element generation.
