# Architect Feedback
<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->
### [2025-05-11 03:15:27] - User Feedback on `attempt_completion` Detail Level
- **Trigger:** User denied `attempt_completion` for the "Unified Quantity Specification" architectural revision (fourth denial).
- **Context:** The previous `attempt_completion` summarized the creation/updates to Memory Bank files, [`docs/architecture_overview.md`](docs/architecture_overview.md), and [`docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md`](docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md).
- **User Feedback Summary:** The user requested "MORE DETAIL IN THE 'RESULTS' MESSAGE" of the `attempt_completion` call.
- **Action by User:** Denied completion.
- **Rationale for Feedback:** To ensure the final summary accurately and comprehensively reflects all work performed and artifacts created/modified.
- **Outcome/Impact:** The `attempt_completion` message needs to be expanded with more explicit details about each step.
- **Follow-up Action (by AI):**
    1. Log this feedback.
    2. Re-craft the `attempt_completion` message to be more verbose and detailed.
    3. Re-attempt completion.
### [2025-05-11 02:59:53] - User Feedback on Reformation Justification
- **Trigger:** User denied `attempt_completion` for the "Unified Quantity Specification" architectural revision (third denial).
- **Context:** The previous `attempt_completion` included the creation of [`docs/architecture_overview.md`](docs/architecture_overview.md), [`docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md`](docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md), and updates to Memory Bank files.
- **User Feedback Summary:** The user requested a clear justification within the guidance document ([`docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md`](docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md)) explaining why reforming the existing specification ([`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md)) is preferable to starting it from scratch.
- **Action by User:** Denied completion and requested this justification be added.
- **Rationale for Feedback:** To ensure the `spec-pseudocode` mode understands the reasoning behind the chosen modification strategy and doesn't opt for an unnecessary overhaul.
- **Outcome/Impact:** The guidance document [`docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md`](docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md) needs to be updated with a section justifying the reformation approach.
- **Follow-up Action (by AI):**
    1. Log this feedback.
    2. Read the current content of [`docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md`](docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md).
    3. Add a new section justifying reformation over a fresh start.
    4. Update the `new_task` instructions for `spec-pseudocode` to ensure this justification is noted.
    5. Re-attempt completion.
### [2025-05-11 02:57:10] - User Feedback on Architectural Documentation Detail
- **Trigger:** User denied `attempt_completion` for the "Unified Quantity Specification" architectural revision (second denial).
- **Context:** The previous `attempt_completion` included the creation of [`docs/architecture_overview.md`](docs/architecture_overview.md) and updates to Memory Bank files.
- **User Feedback Summary:** The user expressed concern that the [`docs/architecture_overview.md`](docs/architecture_overview.md) and previous instructions might lack sufficient detail for `spec-pseudocode` to accurately update the main specification document ([`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md)). They requested a more explicit guide on *how* to apply the new "Unified Quantity Specification" pattern to the existing spec, clarifying whether it's a reformation or requires a complete overhaul.
- **Action by User:** Denied completion and requested more detailed guidance for the `spec-pseudocode` mode.
- **Rationale for Feedback:** To prevent misinterpretation by `spec-pseudocode` and ensure the specification is revised correctly and efficiently.
- **Outcome/Impact:** A new, more detailed guidance document needs to be created to instruct `spec-pseudocode` on the specific changes required in [`specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md`](specifications/synthetic_data_package_specification.md).
- **Follow-up Action (by AI):**
    1. Log this feedback.
    2. Create a new document: [`docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md`](docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md).
    3. Populate this document with detailed instructions, "before/after" examples for key parameters in the current spec, and clarification that this is a reformation.
    4. Update the `new_task` instructions for `spec-pseudocode` to reference this new guidance document.
    5. Re-attempt completion.
### [2025-05-11 02:36:34] - User Feedback on Architectural Update
- **Trigger:** User denied `attempt_completion` for the "Unified Quantity Specification" architectural revision.
- **Context:** The previous `attempt_completion` message detailed updates to Memory Bank files ([`memory-bank/globalContext.md`](memory-bank/globalContext.md), [`memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md`](memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md), [`memory-bank/activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md)) regarding the new quantity specification pattern.
- **User Feedback Summary:** The user indicated that the architectural pattern should also be documented in a general architecture document within the `docs/` directory.
- **Action by User:** Denied completion and provided feedback to include this documentation step.
- **Rationale for Feedback:** Architectural decisions and patterns should be centrally documented for project clarity and maintainability, not just within the Memory Bank.
- **Outcome/Impact:** The "Unified Quantity Specification" pattern needs to be added to a relevant architecture document in `docs/`.
- **Follow-up Action (by AI):**
    1. Log this feedback.
    2. Check for an existing general architecture document in `docs/`.
    3. If one exists, update it. If not, create `docs/architecture_overview.md` and add the pattern.
    4. Re-attempt completion.
