### [2025-05-16 02:41:45] Feedback: Successful Indentation Fix in `PdfGenerator._apply_ocr_noise`
- **Source**: Task: Fix Indentation Errors in `PdfGenerator._apply_ocr_noise`
- **Issue**: Pylance indentation errors (e.g., "Expected expression", "Unexpected indentation") in `_apply_ocr_noise` method of [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:1) after a previous `apply_diff` by `tdd` mode. The core issue was an `elif` block placed after an `else` block at the same indentation level.
- **Action Taken by Code Mode**:
    1. Analyzed the file content and identified the incorrect ordering of `elif` and `else` blocks.
    2. Used `apply_diff` to reorder the `elif noise_type == "gaussian":` block to be correctly positioned before the final `else:` block.
    3. Verified the fix using `python3 -m py_compile synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`, which completed successfully.
- **Learning/Outcome**:
    - Careful analysis of the logical structure of `if/elif/else` chains is crucial, especially after automated modifications.
    - `apply_diff` can be used to reorder blocks of code, not just replace content within them.
    - The file [`synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py`](synth_data_gen/generators/pdf.py:1) is now syntactically correct, unblocking the `tdd` agent for OCR noise simulation tasks.

### [2025-05-15 05:34:27] Feedback: Successful Indentation Fix in `test_epub_generator.py`
- **Source**: Task: Fix Indentation in `test_epub_generator.py`
- **Issue**: Persistent Pylance indentation errors in `test_generate_epub3_with_ncx_only_config` method of [`tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py:1) (approx. lines 2430-2465), blocking `tdd` mode.
- **Action Taken by Code Mode**:
    1. Reviewed TDD feedback ([`memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md`](memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md:1) entry `[2025-05-15 05:29:00]`) and relevant file section (lines 2425-2470).
    2. Identified unindented lines 2430-2431 and an improperly indented blank line at 2432 as primary issues.
    3. Used `apply_diff` to indent lines 2430-2431 by 4 spaces and replace line 2432 with a proper blank line.
    4. Verified the fix using `python3 -m py_compile tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py`, which completed successfully (exit code 0, no output).
- **Learning/Outcome**:
    - A targeted `apply_diff` was effective for correcting specific indentation errors.
    - `python3 -m py_compile` is a good way to quickly check for syntax errors post-modification.
    - The file [`tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py:1) is now syntactically correct, unblocking the `tdd` agent.

### [2025-05-15 04:46:09] Feedback: Successful `SyntaxError` Repair in `test_epub_generator.py`
- **Source**: Task: Critical File Repair - `test_epub_generator.py`
- **Issue**: `SyntaxError: ':' expected after dictionary key` at line 1864 of `tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py`, caused by an extraneous line of code (`mock_book_instance_configured.IDENTIFIER_ID = "BookId"`) misplaced within a dictionary definition. This corruption was introduced during previous automated modification attempts by `debug` mode.
- **Action Taken by Code Mode**:
    1. Read lines 1850-1870 of the file.
    2. Identified the misplaced line 1864 as the cause of the `SyntaxError`.
    3. Used `apply_diff` to remove the single extraneous line.
    4. Verified the fix using `python3 -m py_compile tests/generators/test_epub_generator.py`, which completed successfully.
- **Learning/Outcome**:
    - `apply_diff` was effective for this precise, single-line removal, even in a large and previously problematic file.
    - Careful analysis of the error and surrounding code, informed by `debug` mode's feedback, allowed for a targeted fix.
    - The file is now syntactically correct, unblocking further debugging of the original `TypeError`.
