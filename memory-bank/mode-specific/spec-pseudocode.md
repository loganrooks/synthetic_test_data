### Feature: Synthetic Data Package Generation
- Added: [2025-05-11 02:14:27]
- Description: Develop a Python package to generate synthetic EPUB, PDF, and Markdown files. The package must be highly configurable via YAML or Python dictionaries, allowing detailed control over content, structure, styling, and metadata. It must support extensibility for new data generators and output formats via a plugin system. The package should also provide a default "out-of-the-box" data set if no configuration is supplied. EPUB generation, in particular, requires extreme flexibility to reproduce and vary formatting features observed in complex existing documents.
- Acceptance criteria: 
  1. Package API defined with `generate_data` function.
  2. Configuration mechanism (hybrid YAML/Python) schema fully defined.
  3. Extensibility points (plugin architecture) specified.
  4. Default data set and behavior detailed.
  5. EPUB generation flexibility comprehensively specified to cover all analyzed features.
- Dependencies: Python 3.x, relevant libraries for EPUB (e.g., ebooklib), PDF (e.g., reportlab or similar), Markdown generation.
- Status: Revised (Specification updated with Unified Quantity Specification, prioritizing deterministic defaults, on 2025-05-11 per user feedback)

## System Constraints
<!-- Append new constraints using the format below -->
### Constraint: Python Environment
- Added: [2025-05-11 02:14:27]
- Description: The Synthetic Data Package will be a Python package, requiring a Python 3.x runtime environment.
- Impact: Users must have Python installed. Specific library dependencies for file generation (EPUB, PDF, etc.) will need to be managed.
- Mitigation strategy: Clear documentation on installation and dependencies. Package distribution via PyPI.

### Constraint: Library Dependencies
- Added: [2025-05-11 02:14:27]
- Description: The package will rely on third-party Python libraries for core generation tasks (e.g., `ebooklib` for EPUBs, a PDF library like `reportlab` or `WeasyPrint`, Markdown processing libraries).
- Impact: Package functionality is tied to the capabilities and limitations of these chosen libraries. Version compatibility of dependencies needs management.
- Mitigation strategy: Choose well-maintained libraries. Abstract library-specific calls to allow for potential future replacement. Pin dependency versions.
