### [2025-05-11 23:07:21] Intervention: TDD Task Interruption - Indentation Issue
- **Trigger**: User message clarifying reason for previous TDD task interruption.
- **Context**: The `new_task` for `tdd` mode (delegated at 2025-05-11 22:26:58) was interrupted. User states the cause was incorrect indentation of newly added tests in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`, making them unreachable.
- **Action Taken**: Logged intervention. Will re-delegate to `tdd` mode with instructions to first verify and fix indentation in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` before resuming TDD objectives.
- **Rationale**: To ensure the test file is correctly structured before proceeding with further test development.
- **Outcome**: Pending re-delegation to `tdd`.
- **Follow-up**: New `tdd` task to include indentation check and fix.
- Current phase: Testing
- Phase start: 2025-05-11 22:10:28
- Current focus: Resume TDD for `synthetic_test_data` package, focusing on advanced generator logic and EPUB components.
- Next actions: Delegate to `tdd` mode.
- Last Updated: 2025-05-11 22:10:28

## Delegations Log
### [2025-05-11 22:10:28] Task: Advanced TDD for Generator Logic and EPUB Components
- Assigned to: tdd
- Description: Resume TDD cycle. Objectives include: Completing detailed unit tests for `PdfGenerator.generate()` (probabilistic `page_count_config`, other settings); Comprehensive tests for `MarkdownGenerator.generate()` (all quantity types, GFM features, frontmatter); Comprehensive tests for `EpubGenerator.generate()` (Unified Quantity Specs, styling, features); Comprehensive unit tests for all `epub_components` modules and their integration into `EpubGenerator`; Full implementation and testing of the `ConfigLoader` class.
- Expected deliverable: Passing tests and implemented features as per the TDD cycle. Regular commits and Memory Bank updates.
- Status: completed
- Completion time: 2025-05-11 22:26:20
- Outcome: Completed testing for MarkdownGenerator count-based configurations and basic frontmatter. All new tests passed. Context at 44%.

## Intervention Log
### [2025-05-11 14:21:00] Intervention: Early Return from TDD Mode
### [2025-05-11 22:26:49] Task: Advanced TDD for Generator Logic and EPUB Components (Continuation)
- Assigned to: tdd
- Description: Continue TDD cycle. Objectives include: Completing `MarkdownGenerator` frontmatter tests; Proceeding with `PdfGenerator` tests (probabilistic `page_count_config`, other settings); `EpubGenerator` tests (Unified Quantity Specs, styling, features); `epub_components` unit tests; `ConfigLoader` implementation and testing.
- Expected deliverable: Passing tests and implemented features as per the TDD cycle. Regular commits and Memory Bank updates.
- Status: pending
- Link to Progress Entry: (Will be created by tdd mode)
- **Trigger**: `tdd` mode invoked Early Return.
- **Context**: Persistent `apply_diff` failures modifying `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1). High context window (48%).
- **Action Taken**: Logged Early Return. Will review `tdd` feedback log and then delegate a focused fix for the specific test.
- **Rationale**: To address the blocker with a fresh context and precise instructions as recommended by `tdd` mode.
- **Outcome**: Pending review of feedback and redelegation.
- **Follow-up**: Delegate focused task to fix the test.
### [2025-05-11 03:29:27] Intervention: User Correction on Delegation Process
### [2025-05-11 22:08:41] Task: Project Handover due to Context Limit
- Assigned to: sparc (new instance)
- Description: Handover of `synthetic_test_data` package development due to current SPARC instance reaching 51% context capacity.
- Expected deliverable: New SPARC instance to take over orchestration, starting with debugging the `TypeError` in `tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`.
- Status: pending
- Link to Progress Entry: (Will be created by new SPARC instance)
- **Trigger**: User feedback on `new_task` delegation to `spec-pseudocode`.
- **Context**: SPARC attempted to delegate specification revision without first reading the architect's output documents ([`docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md`](docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md) and [`docs/architecture_overview.md`](docs/architecture_overview.md)).
- **Action Taken**: Logged intervention. Read the specified architectural documents. Preparing to re-delegate to `spec-pseudocode` with fully informed instructions.
- **Rationale**: To ensure delegation instructions are precise and based on a complete understanding of the architect's work, as per user guidance.
- **Outcome**: Architectural documents reviewed.
- **Follow-up**: Re-delegate task to `spec-pseudocode` with updated, informed instructions.
### [2025-05-11 02:01:22] Intervention: User Request for More Detailed Specifications
- **Trigger**: User feedback on `new_task` delegation to `spec-pseudocode`.
- **Context**: Initial delegation for specification drafting was deemed insufficiently detailed by the user.
- **Action Taken**: Logged intervention. Re-delegating task to `spec-pseudocode` with a more explicit instruction for comprehensive and detailed specifications.
- **Rationale**: To meet user requirements for the depth and breadth of the specification document.
- **Outcome**: Pending re-delegation.
- **Follow-up**: Monitor output from `spec-pseudocode` to ensure detailed specifications are produced.
