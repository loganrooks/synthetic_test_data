## Intervention Log
### [2025-05-11 14:21:00] Intervention: Early Return from TDD Mode
- **Trigger**: `tdd` mode invoked Early Return.
- **Context**: Persistent `apply_diff` failures modifying `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1). High context window (48%).
- **Action Taken**: Logged Early Return. Will review `tdd` feedback log and then delegate a focused fix for the specific test.
- **Rationale**: To address the blocker with a fresh context and precise instructions as recommended by `tdd` mode.
- **Outcome**: Pending review of feedback and redelegation.
- **Follow-up**: Delegate focused task to fix the test.
### [2025-05-11 03:29:27] Intervention: User Correction on Delegation Process
- **Trigger**: User feedback on `new_task` delegation to `spec-pseudocode`.
- **Context**: SPARC attempted to delegate specification revision without first reading the architect's output documents ([`docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md`](docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md) and [`docs/architecture_overview.md`](docs/architecture_overview.md)).
- **Action Taken**: Logged intervention. Read the specified architectural documents. Preparing to re-delegate to `spec-pseudocode` with fully informed instructions.
- **Rationale**: To ensure delegation instructions are precise and based on a complete understanding of the architect's work, as per user guidance.
- **Outcome**: Architectural documents reviewed.
- **Follow-up**: Re-delegate task to `spec-pseudocode` with updated, informed instructions.
### [2025-05-11 02:01:22] Intervention: User Request for More Detailed Specifications
- **Trigger**: User feedback on `new_task` delegation to `spec-pseudocode`.
- **Context**: Initial delegation for specification drafting was deemed insufficiently detailed by the user.
- **Action Taken**: Logged intervention. Re-delegating task to `spec-pseudocode` with a more explicit instruction for comprehensive and detailed specifications.
- **Rationale**: To meet user requirements for the depth and breadth of the specification document.
- **Outcome**: Pending re-delegation.
- **Follow-up**: Monitor output from `spec-pseudocode` to ensure detailed specifications are produced.
