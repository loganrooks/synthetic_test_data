- **Outcome**: New `tdd` task will be created.
- **Follow-up**: Monitor new `tdd` task.
- **Context**: The `new_task` for `tdd` mode (delegated at 2025-05-11 22:26:58) was interrupted. User states the cause was incorrect indentation of newly added tests in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`, making them unreachable.
- **Action Taken**: Logged intervention. Re-delegated to `tdd` mode with instructions to first verify and fix indentation in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` before resuming TDD objectives.
- **Rationale**: To ensure the test file is correctly structured before proceeding with further test development.
- **Outcome**: Re-delegation to `tdd` completed.
- **Follow-up**: New `tdd` task included indentation check and fix.
### [2025-05-11 14:21:00] Intervention: Early Return from TDD Mode
- **Trigger**: `tdd` mode invoked Early Return.
- **Context**: Persistent `apply_diff` failures modifying `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1). High context window (48%).
- **Action Taken**: Logged Early Return. Reviewed `tdd` feedback log and then delegated a focused fix for the specific test.
- **Rationale**: To address the blocker with a fresh context and precise instructions as recommended by `tdd` mode.
- **Outcome**: Delegation for focused fix completed.
- **Follow-up**: Task delegated to `tdd` to fix the specific test.
### [2025-05-11 03:29:27] Intervention: User Correction on Delegation Process
- **Trigger**: User feedback on `new_task` delegation to `spec-pseudocode`.
- **Context**: SPARC attempted to delegate specification revision without first reading the architect's output documents ([`docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md`](docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md:1) and [`docs/architecture_overview.md`](docs/architecture_overview.md:1)).
- **Action Taken**: Logged intervention. Read the specified architectural documents. Prepared to re-delegate to `spec-pseudocode` with fully informed instructions.
- **Rationale**: To ensure delegation instructions are precise and based on a complete understanding of the architect's work, as per user guidance.
- **Outcome**: Architectural documents reviewed. Re-delegation completed.
- **Follow-up**: Monitored output from `spec-pseudocode`.
### [2025-05-11 02:01:22] Intervention: User Request for More Detailed Specifications
- **Trigger**: User feedback on `new_task` delegation to `spec-pseudocode`.
- **Context**: Initial delegation for specification drafting was deemed insufficiently detailed by the user.
- **Action Taken**: Logged intervention. Re-delegated task to `spec-pseudocode` with a more explicit instruction for comprehensive and detailed specifications.
- **Rationale**: To meet user requirements for the depth and breadth of the specification document.
- **Outcome**: Re-delegation completed.
- **Follow-up**: Monitored output from `spec-pseudocode`.

# Workflow State (Current - Overwrite this section)
- Current phase: Refinement
- Phase start: 2025-05-16 12:55:55 (Original task start)
- Current focus: Test run (`PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`) after `debug` agent's fixes (Delegation Log `[2025-05-16 14:00:00]`) resulted in 3 failed tests. Preparing to re-delegate debugging.
- Next actions:
    - Delegate to `debug` mode to investigate and fix the 3 failing tests in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1):
        - [`test_single_column_with_probabilistic_table_occurrence`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1171): `AssertionError: Expected 'random' to have been called once. Called 2 times.` (Likely an incomplete fix from the previous debug task for Scenario 2).
        - [`test_single_column_with_probabilistic_figure_occurrence`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1359): `AssertionError: Expected 'random' to have been called once. Called 2 times.` (Likely an incomplete fix from the previous debug task for Scenario 2).
        - [`test_visual_toc_is_integrated_into_pdf_story`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:2990): `AssertionError: Expected ToC flowable with text containing 'Chapter Alpha <dot leaderFill/> (PAGE_REF:ch_alpha_key)' not found in story.`
    - `debug` agent should also verify that `test_ligature_simulation_setting_is_respected`, `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_probabilistic`, and `test_generate_single_column_page_count_probabilistic` are still passing.
    - After test fixes, re-delegate "Refactor `PdfGenerator` Visual ToC - Implement Dynamic Page Numbers & Robust Dot Leaders" to a new `tdd` agent.
