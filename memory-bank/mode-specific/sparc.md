## Intervention Log
### [2025-05-11 23:07:21] Intervention: TDD Task Interruption - Indentation Issue
- **Trigger**: User message clarifying reason for previous TDD task interruption.
- **Context**: The `new_task` for `tdd` mode (delegated at 2025-05-11 22:26:58) was interrupted. User states the cause was incorrect indentation of newly added tests in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py`, making them unreachable.
- **Action Taken**: Logged intervention. Re-delegated to `tdd` mode with instructions to first verify and fix indentation in `tests/generators/test_markdown_generator.py` before resuming TDD objectives.
- **Rationale**: To ensure the test file is correctly structured before proceeding with further test development.
- **Outcome**: Re-delegation to `tdd` completed.
- **Follow-up**: New `tdd` task included indentation check and fix.
### [2025-05-11 14:21:00] Intervention: Early Return from TDD Mode
- **Trigger**: `tdd` mode invoked Early Return.
- **Context**: Persistent `apply_diff` failures modifying `test_generate_single_column_unified_chapters_range` in [`tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py`](tests/generators/test_pdf_generator.py:1). High context window (48%).
- **Action Taken**: Logged Early Return. Reviewed `tdd` feedback log and then delegated a focused fix for the specific test.
- **Rationale**: To address the blocker with a fresh context and precise instructions as recommended by `tdd` mode.
- **Outcome**: Delegation for focused fix completed.
- **Follow-up**: Task delegated to `tdd` to fix the specific test.
### [2025-05-11 03:29:27] Intervention: User Correction on Delegation Process
- **Trigger**: User feedback on `new_task` delegation to `spec-pseudocode`.
- **Context**: SPARC attempted to delegate specification revision without first reading the architect's output documents ([`docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md`](docs/spec_revision_guidance_unified_quantity.md) and [`docs/architecture_overview.md`](docs/architecture_overview.md)).
- **Action Taken**: Logged intervention. Read the specified architectural documents. Prepared to re-delegate to `spec-pseudocode` with fully informed instructions.
- **Rationale**: To ensure delegation instructions are precise and based on a complete understanding of the architect's work, as per user guidance.
- **Outcome**: Architectural documents reviewed. Re-delegation completed.
- **Follow-up**: Monitored output from `spec-pseudocode`.
### [2025-05-11 02:01:22] Intervention: User Request for More Detailed Specifications
- **Trigger**: User feedback on `new_task` delegation to `spec-pseudocode`.
- **Context**: Initial delegation for specification drafting was deemed insufficiently detailed by the user.
- **Action Taken**: Logged intervention. Re-delegated task to `spec-pseudocode` with a more explicit instruction for comprehensive and detailed specifications.
- **Rationale**: To meet user requirements for the depth and breadth of the specification document.
- **Outcome**: Re-delegation completed.
- **Follow-up**: Monitored output from `spec-pseudocode`.
