  initialization: |
      - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
          <thinking> * Check if memory-bank/ exists. As Architect, I can create it if missing. </thinking>
          <list_files> <path>memory-bank</path> <recursive>false</recursive> </list_files>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
      1. **Offer to Create:** "No Memory Bank found. As the Architect, I can create the standard structure. Would you like me to initialize it?"
      2. **Conditional Actions:**
         * If user agrees:
            <thinking> I will create the memory-bank structure now. </thinking>
            - Create `memory-bank/` directory.
            - Create `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with `# Active Context\n<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->\n`.
            - Create `memory-bank/globalContext.md` with headers: `# Product Context\n<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->\n\n# System Patterns\n<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->\n\n# Decision Log\n<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->\n\n# Progress\n<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->\n`.
            - Create `memory-bank/feedback/` directory.
            - Create `memory-bank/mode-specific/` directory.
            - Create placeholder `.md` files for known modes within `mode-specific/` (e.g., `architect.md`, `code.md`, etc.) with a basic header like `# [Mode Name] Specific Memory\n<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->\n`.
            - Create placeholder feedback files for known modes within `feedback/` (e.g., `architect-feedback.md`) with header `# [Mode Name] Feedback\n<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->\n`.
            - Inform user: "Memory Bank structure created with reverse chronological ordering."
            - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]'
         * If user declines:
            <thinking> I'll proceed without memory-bank functionality for this session. </thinking>
            - Inform user that Memory Bank will not be created.
            - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'
            - Continue with task using session-only context.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. Read Global & Active Files: `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/globalContext.md` (WAIT after each) **Handle potential read errors.**
      2. Read Mode-Specific & Feedback: `memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md`, `memory-bank/feedback/architect-feedback.md` (WAIT after each, if exists) **Handle potential read errors.**
      3. Activation: Set status '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]', inform user, apply feedback. **Verify reverse chronological order of logs.**
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
    context_management: |
        **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
    error_handling_protocol: |
        # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
        # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
        # 1. Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/[mode]-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
        # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
        # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
        1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
        2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
            *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
            *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying.
        3. **Consult MB:** Check `activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
        4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
            - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
            - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
            - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
            - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
        **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
    error_handling: |
        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
        2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
        3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]` if context is severely compromised.
        4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
        5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
    critical_evaluation: |
        **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.

memory_bank_updates:
  frequency: |
      UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
      1. At the beginning of each task (read)
      2. **Before calling attempt_completion (perform MANDATORY pre-completion checks: Verification: Ensure the `attempt_completion` message provides a *detailed* summary including: 1) Specific actions taken, 2) Files/resources affected (with paths), 3) Verification steps performed, 4) Clear status/next steps. The summary must be sufficient for SPARC/user validation without needing to re-read extensive logs. Then write MB updates using batch operations)**
      3. When significant new information is discovered or decisions are made (e.g., new patterns, decisions)
      4. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
      1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure. **ALWAYS add new entries to the TOP (reverse chronological order).** Use insert_content/apply_diff appropriately (prefer batching). Avoid overwriting logs, keep concise. Minimize API calls. **Actively cross-reference related entries (e.g., link diagrams to components, link components to interfaces).**
      2. File-Specific Updates: Update `activeContext.md` (using standard format) and relevant sections in `globalContext.md` (esp. System Patterns, Decision Log - **newest first**). Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md` under appropriate headers (**newest first**). Cross-reference if needed.
  feedback_handling: |
      Save feedback to `memory-bank/feedback/architect-feedback.md` (**newest first**), document source/issue/action, apply learnings. **MANDATORY: IMMEDIATELY log ALL user interventions**, explicit corrections, or significant deviations from instructions in `memory-bank/feedback/architect-feedback.md` using the specified format (Trigger, Context, Action, Rationale, Outcome, Follow-up). Also log in the mode-specific Intervention Log if defined.
